fe008|all right.|S
fe008|so uh welcome back.|S
fe008|thank you for coming.|S
fe008|um so what i thought we'd do today is pick up where we were last time.|S
fe008|and maybe uh go over some some ideas about um|D
fe008|well the return to the conventions.|S
fe008|but i also wanted to uh share with you a couple of the things that i've picked up in terms of checking.|S
fe008|and these are uh these are things that came up with the with the tigerfish transcripts.|S
fe008|i'm just doing this because i think it's interesting.|S
fe008|okay so um i have an example|D
fe066|okay not sure.|D
fe066|thank you.|S
fe067|oh there's hold on.|S
fe008|which|D
fe008|um so there're a couple of examples.|S
fe008|i have one in front of you which is the one where|D
fe008|um um|F
fe008|leah leah noticed this one where i said something and um the transcriber interpreted it as twosome gruesome uh different sizes different this.|S
fe008|and um actually what i meant to say was um so you're saying groups of different sizes.|S
fe008|different size groups.|S
fe066|whoa.|S
fe008|yeah.|S
me070|wow.|S
fe008|i|D
fe008|it's really enormously far away.|S
fe008|now this this could be one of those cases where the auditory was just really bad.|S
fe069|that's what i was just thinking.|S
fe069|or maybe it was really quiet or something.|S
fe069|i don't know.|S
fe008|maybe very very soft.|S
fe008|maybe with the microphone noise.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|or something from someone else.|S
fe008|or an overlap.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|or|F
fe008|but they're not usually that bad i i don't think.|S
fe068|uhhuh.|B
fe008|then um i have a couple of others.|S
fe008|so there's one um|D
fe008|so the person said interesting idea.|S
fe008|but tigerfish thought it was uh just an idea.|S
fe008|now that changes the meaning.|S
fe066|right.|S
fe067|huh.|B
fe008|it's interesting.|S
me070|huh.|B
fe068|right.|S
fe008|and then there are various ones like um um ish decay instead of h.t.k.|S
fe066|oh.|B
fe069|ugh.|S
fe008|and now this one|D
fe068|ish decay?|Q
fe008|ish decay.|S
fe008|now ish was in parentheses.|S
fe066|ish decay.|S
fe068|yeah what's an ish?|Q
fe008|well they they they were suspicious that wasn't right.|S
fe008|but that was the closest they could come.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and you know with when you're dealing with acronyms|D
fe069|wow.|S
fe008|that's that's that shows one of the problems with acronyms.|S
fe068|yeah.|B
fe008|is that it's clear if you know it.|S
fe069|i wonder if that was someone who was who had an accent maybe.|S
fe008|but|F
fe008|always conceivable.|S
fe008|i don't remember off hand.|S
fe008|i did check the example.|S
fe008|and um|F
fe008|well and this this would be consistent.|S
fe008|so uh it was transcribed as with h. .|S
fe008|but it was really with age.|S
fe069|huh.|B
fe066|huh.|B
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|yeah.|B
fe008|and uh then there are some where actually punctuation changes the meaning.|S
fe008|so this is these are things that barbara uh found.|S
fe008|spurts wouldn't be right was what it looked like.|S
fe008|but actually when you listen to it it would be spurts wouldn't be right.|S
fe066|oh.|S
fe067|huh.|B
me070|huh.|S
fe069|oh.|S
fe069|that's very subtle.|S
fe008|it is subtle.|S
fe008|and yet you know it's like and instead of instead of and it's they put annette's.|S
me070|annette's?|Q
fe008|now this this is interesting.|S
fe008|because it's like you know we know that there's no annette on any of the meetings we've ever dealt with.|S
me070|right.|S
fe069|right.|S
fe008|but um it's you know conceivable.|S
fe066|right.|S
me070|huh.|B
fe008|and then|D
fe008|um|F
fe008|let's see.|S
fe008|there's one other here i thought was interesting.|S
fe008|well this was|D
fe008|okay so it should have been the quals the the quals slides will be fine.|S
fe008|this is jerry feldman.|S
fe008|and uh instead it was transcribed with the and then an uncertain syllable the the and then all the slides will be fine.|S
fe066|uh.|S
fe008|which is interesting.|S
fe068|oh.|S
fe008|and and you know this was a case where the timebin was off.|S
fe067|huh.|B
fe008|i wanted to bring an example where|D
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe069|oh.|B
fe066|yeah.|B
fe008|so all the slides it's started too late.|S
me070|right.|B
fe008|it's another case of devoicing at the initial|D
fe066|right.|B
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|yeah.|S
fe008|so i thought that was very interesting.|S
fe008|and i think that it shows um these sorts of things i was thinking it would be interesting to do an analysis of these things.|S
fe008|because i think that|D
fe008|um|F
fe008|if well first of all there's this overall point that it shows a degree to which when you listen to speech and when you're just in general listening probably.|S
fe008|but it shows specifically this to this task that it's very constructive.|S
fe008|you're not going on simply the auditory there's a huge contribution from the top down processing.|S
fe008|and the you know different types.|S
fe008|you've got the contextual information.|S
fe008|you have syntax.|S
fe008|you have your mastery of english and these various things.|S
fe008|but i think these kinds of errors it just shows the degree which it's not strictly an acoustic task.|S
me070|uhhuh yeah.|B
fe069|oh yeah.|S
fe008|and the other thing i think that's interesting is the types of the types of confusions that happen um do preserve certain aspects of the stimulus.|S
fe066|uhhuh.|B
fe008|so the stress tends to be preserved.|S
fe008|you know the content word will be substituted for another content word.|S
fe008|and um|F
fe008|it's it's not surprising that they would hear this.|S
fe008|i'm i'm often surprised by how how plausible something can be with without it being correct.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|because it really seems like it's|D
fe066|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and then often you know it's um there's the parentheses are used.|S
fe008|so the person knew it wasn't really a perfect match.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|but uh|F
fe008|okay now having said that i'm i'm impressed by how by how um well how infrequent these these kinds of extreme cases are.|S
fe008|most of the types of things that i find in checking are much much more mild.|S
fe008|yeah so so|F
fe068|uhhuh.|B
fe008|do you want to|D
fe068|actually that comes back to a point.|S
fe068|we had talked about this last week where you were interested in so.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe068|saying so at the end of something.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe068|and sometimes that would get transcribed as|D
fe068|okay so let me just think of an example.|S
fe068|um|F
fe068|okay let's say i say well that would be hard to do so.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe068|okay right?|Q
fe068|and the way i would transcribe it i would put that so that would be hard comma so.|S
fe068|at the end.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe068|because it's kind of just the end of that the|D
me070|uhhuh.|B
me070|would you put a period after so?|Q
fe068|right.|S
me070|you would or you wouldn't?|Q
fe068|so|F
fe068|yeah.|S
fe068|yeah i would just sort of end it.|S
me070|yes.|S
me070|uhhuh.|S
fe068|but then sometimes they transcribe it like so that would be a problem period new word like capitalized so.|S
fe066|oh.|B
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me070|right.|S
fe069|oh like it's a whole new utterance.|S
fe069|like it's not connected.|S
fe068|right and and it just seems to totally that that's not the meaning.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe068|and and it changes the meaning i think.|S
fe068|um|F
fe008|in a way|D
fe008|so uh let me be sure i understand.|S
fe008|so you're saying|D
fe008|boy it's hard to uh that ignore that word!|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|um|F
fe008|so the example is that would be hard.|S
fe068|or whatever yeah.|S
fe068|that would be a problem.|S
fe008|that'd be a problem.|S
fe068|whatever.|S
me070|right.|B
fe068|yeah.|B
fe008|so|F
fe068|so|F
fe008|and how does it change the meaning?|Q
fe008|what's what are the two different meanings there?|Q
fe068|it seems like because if i was just reading that thing i would say so that would be a problem so.|S
fe008|okay.|S
fe068|you know what i mean?|Q
fe068|if if it was like period capital s.o. as opposed to um that would be a problem so.|S
fe008|oh i see what you're saying.|S
fe068|that would be a problem so.|S
me070|right|F
fe066|it it|D
me070|i think the second one where the so is all by itself it's like so that would be a problem so.|S
me070|you know the so is like disconnected from the|D
fe066|right as though it's leading into something else.|S
fe069|it's like kind of like introducing|D
me070|yeah the first one is like the so is connected to the sentence.|S
fe066|bu and|D
me070|and that'd be a problem so.|S
fe066|yeah.|B
me070|you know it's but the next one is like not not connected to that would be a problem.|S
me070|it's like so.|S
fe069|it's like introducing a new thing that they don't talk about.|S
fe066|a new subject.|S
me070|yeah less|D
fe068|right yeah.|S
fe066|the first one too is more like|D
fe068|so|D
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe066|to me i don't necessarily put um like a a a a period after that so.|S
fe066|i might actually either put a dash after it depending on whether or not they got interrupted or something.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe066|or i would maybe even act as though they were um just trailing off.|S
me070|right.|B
fe066|so put that those two dots after it.|S
me070|i do that too.|S
fe066|um uh which depending on what's going on like i'll do that.|S
fe066|because to me it sounds more like they're trailing off.|S
me070|right.|B
me070|sometimes though it does sound like they ended a sentence.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
me070|and then i do|D
fe066|yeah yeah yeah yeah.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe067|huh.|B
me070|like sometimes it's just like that'd be hard so.|S
fe068|right.|S
me070|you know and but and then often it sounds like they were trying to think of something else to say.|S
fe066|right.|S
fe066|yeah.|B
me070|but they couldn't really you know|D
me070|and then they get interrupted and then i put a dash.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe069|yep.|B
me070|you know but i never usually put period and then new word so unless it's like end of the sentence and then so.|S
fe069|what are we going to do now.|S
fe069|but they don't say that.|S
me070|huh.|B
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me070|yeah.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe068|uhhuh.|B
fe008|it's it's interesting that there are so many cases.|S
fe008|and i agree.|S
fe008|i i think those are very good conventions.|S
fe008|i also like you know this this whole point about how how that the fact that you're raising this|D
fe008|i i like this example that um we have several things that are being cued by intonation.|S
fe068|right.|S
fe008|because if if that's a nice full falling intonational contour on that's a problem.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|uh that'll be a problem.|S
fe008|then i would think that there should be a period there.|S
fe066|period right.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|right.|S
fe008|and then especially if you've got a pause following it.|S
fe008|but you don't always|D
fe008|these things are correlated but they're not perfect.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|that's another thing is if you're not a native speaker of english you might not pick up.|S
fe066|because uh you know every language has different um intonation mappings.|S
fe068|uhhuh.|B
me070|yeah that's always one of the hardest parts about the native speakers.|S
fe008|uhhuh uhhuh.|B
fe066|and|D
me070|is you don't know exactly like how to do the punctuation.|S
fe066|right.|B
me070|because their intonation is totally different.|S
fe008|you mean non native non native speakers.|S
me070|i mean non native speakers is what i meant yeah.|S
fe008|yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|absolutely yeah absolutely.|S
fe066|and also if you're a non native speaker transcribing it you wouldn't necessarily uh understand the conventions of english intonation as you know intimately as a native speaker might.|S
me070|yeah that's true.|S
me070|right uhhuh.|B
fe069|well i would hope they would have native speaker transcribers transcribing.|S
fe008|ideally wouldn't that be something?|S
fe008|ideally it would be nice to have like a spaniard transcribing the|D
fe069|oh yeah.|S
fe008|oh is that what you mean?|Q
fe008|or|D
fe069|no that's not what i meant.|S
me070|oh.|S
fe069|but that would be cool.|S
fe008|that'd be nice.|S
fe069|no what i meant was that i would hope that for meetings in english you would have native speakers transcribing it.|S
fe069|because it you would have more intuitions about what should be there.|S
fe008|i agree.|S
me070|yeah.|S
fe066|yeah.|S
fe069|even if you can't fully understand the word you can make a guess you can that isn't completely off like some of these are.|S
fe066|right.|B
fe069|but they're pretty rare.|S
fe069|those things the|D
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe069|the really bad mistakes that they make are pretty rare.|S
fe069|i think so.|S
fe008|i i so in terms of like when you're going through the tigerfish transcripts you don't find a lot of these kinds of extreme cases.|S
fe069|not this|D
fe066|not so much no.|S
fe008|okay.|S
fe069|i mean|D
me070|huh not twosome gruesome.|S
fe069|no not twosome gruesome.|S
fe069|sometimes.|S
fe069|but they tend to be pretty good about parentheses.|S
fe066|uhhuh.|B
fe008|uhhuh.|S
fe008|good good to hear.|S
me070|yeah.|S
me070|yeah sometimes they they usually put them in parentheses.|S
me070|and you think to yourself you were way off.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|but at least you knew you were way off.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe069|yeah.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe069|exactly.|S
fe068|yeah i just wonder like what influences them to think of twosome gruesome.|S
fe008|good.|B
fe068|like maybe this person just saw a horror movie or something.|S
fe068|and|F
fe068|uh this is the interpretation that came to mind or something.|S
fe008|it's could be.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe068|you know what i mean?|Q
fe068|like where would you get the word gruesome?|Q
fe069|i don't know.|S
fe068|you know you just sort of pull it out of the air.|S
fe069|well i mean you get the g.r. from groups i guess.|S
fe068|anyway.|S
fe069|but|F
fe068|yeah.|S
me070|yeah.|S
fe069|i don't know where the rest of it came from.|S
me070|uh groups of.|S
me070|gruesome.|S
fe066|group.|S
fe068|okay.|S
fe066|groups of.|S
fe066|gruesome.|S
me070|you've got the uh s. in the middle.|S
fe066|yeah if you if for some reason they didn't hear the f. if they didn't hear the fuh it might just sound like|D
me070|gruesome.|S
fe066|yeah uh gruesuh.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
me070|yeah it's both labial at the end.|S
fe068|uhhuh.|D
fe066|you know and then you would kind of have to come up with some sort of consonant.|S
fe069|groups of|D
fe066|and maybe it's an m. to you.|S
fe069|well also|D
fe068|right.|F
fe069|group of groups of groups of group|D
fe066|fff because also i mean f. is fff is um fff|D
me070|gruesome groups of gruesome groups of|D
fe069|i wonder where the p. went though.|S
fe066|right fff because it's|D
me070|maybe the p. wasn't pronounced very well.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe068|pss.|D
me070|like groups of.|S
fe066|yeah because it's um bilabial too.|S
fe066|fff you know you'll|D
fe066|uh or interdental fff.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe066|you know it's close enough i guess to huh you know.|S
fe069|nnn i guess.|S
fe066|you're getting the closure of the lips.|S
fe066|so maybe that's what they were getting.|S
fe066|i don't know.|S
fe069|it's possible.|S
fe067|huh.|B
me070|huh.|B
fe008|well you know there's also this problem that they didn't have context to constrain the interpretation.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
me070|yeah.|S
fe008|because|D
fe008|yeah.|B
me070|yeah that's really hard.|S
fe008|okay.|D
me070|to not be able to go and listen to the other channels and figure out the context of what it's occurring in.|S
fe066|yeah.|B
fe008|yeah when i'm clearing the parentheses i find that very useful.|S
fe008|i i sometimes i try to just go through and pick up the parentheses.|S
me070|yeah.|B
fe008|see if i can do it just by itself.|S
fe008|but it it's remarkable how sometimes something can be so totally opaque.|S
fe008|and then you go back to you know the person's previous utterance.|S
fe008|or you go to the mixed channel.|S
fe008|or you uh check on the other things.|S
fe008|and suddenly it becomes perfectly clear.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|it's very very surprising.|S
fe008|very surprising.|S
fe066|yeah.|B
fe008|good.|B
fe068|but this other business um that you have at the bottom with people getting transcribed on another channel.|S
fe008|yes.|B
fe068|is uh is much more common.|S
fe069|is that what it's about?|Q
fe069|i wasn't i couldn't i don't know for some reason that didn't make sense to me.|S
fe069|but it's about when things are transcribed on other channels than what they're set on.|S
fe068|right.|S
fe069|okay.|S
fe068|and what's always funny to me is when it's you know they miss the gender completely.|S
fe068|like you know morgan will be on jane's channel.|S
fe068|or just something bizarre like that.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe068|um so|F
fe066|well maybe it's because they don't realize that you're supposed to|D
fe066|do they|D
fe066|i mean maybe they don't really realize that you're supposed to split it up or something.|S
fe066|like they maybe think well i hear it just as clearly.|S
fe066|i hear this other person's voice just as clearly.|S
fe066|or something.|S
fe066|and i realize it's not jane.|S
fe066|and i realize it's not a female even.|S
fe066|but um because it's so clear on this channel i'm supposed to transcribe it.|S
fe069|i'm supposed to do it.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|i i'd imagine that's that might be what that is.|S
fe069|they probably don't even know how many people are at the meeting or anything.|S
fe008|yeah it's really an odd task in in a way.|S
fe008|because they're they have no clues at all about how dominant the speaker is on the channel they're transcribing.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe069|yeah.|B
fe068|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and the pre-segmenter doesn't give them any or the information either.|S
fe008|i'm i'm sure that it's because of the|D
me070|yeah.|B
fe069|wow.|S
fe068|yeah.|B
fe069|we're we're really spoiled then with our interface here.|S
fe067|huh.|B
fe068|fancy-schmancy.|S
fe069|right?|Q
fe008|yeah.|B
fe069|i mean it's very useful.|S
fe068|if i was going to make just a guess though from my experience it would seem like the men get um|D
fe008|yes.|B
fe068|the men get moved onto other channels maybe more frequently.|S
fe068|and it's just probably because they have deeper voices.|S
fe068|and they're getting picked up on more channels um than their own channel.|S
fe008|that would make that would make some sense.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe068|um for you know it's an acoustic thing.|S
fe008|okay.|D
fe069|or they just tend to peak louder maybe.|S
fe066|that's true they do they do say that men's voices carry better.|S
fe068|yeah.|B
fe066|i mean that's why they use like i|D
fe066|who was telling me?|Q
fe066|ian maddieson was talking about this that they use male voices in um in um airports.|S
fe008|oh!|S
me070|huh.|B
fe066|because the acoustics of it it just fits into the a hearer's range.|S
fe069|for announcements and things?|Q
fe066|yeah that's it fits into a hearer's range of perception um better than a lot of female voices.|S
fe067|huh.|B
fe068|huh.|B
fe069|huh.|B
fe066|and so that's why they use male voices.|S
fe066|we were just talking about that.|S
fe069|they should do that at bart too.|S
fe069|because sometimes it's hard to hear.|S
fe008|i see.|S
fe067|and now they have those strange computerized voices that|D
fe008|so|F
fe069|yeah those are actually probably just the computer problem.|S
me070|huh.|B
fe069|not the gender problem.|S
fe008|huh.|B
fe008|so so this means that people with hearing problems would hear uh uh one of these announcements better if it were a male voice then.|S
fe066|yeah depending on their auditory um capabilities.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|S
fe066|i mean if their auditory capabilities uh have been you know um squished down like in a certain place where it would be easier for a person with normal um hearing to hear a male's voice|D
fe066|um like if i'm saying if if they if they had a some sort of um you know damage to part of their brain that processes auditory information then|D
fe066|and uh|D
fe066|if that part of the brain normally codes for you know male voices uh in a normal hearer then they might not be able to.|S
fe066|you know does that make sense?|S
fe008|uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh.|S
fe066|like if that part is damaged.|S
fe066|so but um|F
fe008|selective.|S
fe066|but yeah if i guess for most hearers it's just easier.|S
fe066|and it's like a certain uh kind of like rough male voice too.|S
fe066|kind of graspy.|S
fe066|raspy i mean.|S
fe068|huh.|B
fe067|huh.|B
me070|huh.|B
fe066|apparently.|S
fe069|huh.|B
fe008|is better?|Q
fe066|is better.|S
fe008|uh it's a wider band then.|S
fe008|because of|D
fe008|do you think it might be from the|D
fe066|yeah i guess so.|S
fe008|she asked this question last time which was um whether our system here the recording system may have some of the same channel some sort of channel restrictions such as they ran across when they were looking at telephone uh transmissions at a certain point.|S
fe008|because you know telephone transmissions um there's some filtering going on.|S
fe008|you don't hear the full the full band of frequencies.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe069|oh.|S
me070|right.|B
fe067|huh.|B
fe008|and uh i asked a couple of people and they answer came back that|D
fe066|it's really interesting.|S
fe008|it was an interesting|D
fe008|it's reminded me because of the comment about noise.|S
fe008|noise being really spreading frequencies across uh using frequencies across a broader spectrum.|S
fe066|uhhuh.|B
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|so in a way bandwidth can increase with some of these cases of distortion that we have.|S
fe008|but it's it's not a useful kind of increase in frequency range.|S
fe066|right yeah i was just saying that it like you know sometimes um if remember i was saying like if there's a discrepancy between fricatives you know like um shuh or suh will show up in a certain part of the spectrum.|S
fe066|and and uh oftentimes the fuh is like knocked out of the spectrum by|D
fe069|yeah by filtering or something?|Q
fe066|um by filtering in some of the older phones.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe066|and that's why like|D
fe067|huh.|B
fe069|so what was the answer here?|Q
fe069|it that's not the case?|Q
fe008|answer|D
fe066|that they don't|D
fe008|that they that they don't.|S
fe008|we don't have a reduction in that direction.|S
fe069|oh okay.|S
fe066|right.|B
me070|oh.|B
fe069|good.|S
fe008|that uh i mean you know one could have if one had cheaper microphones than we have.|S
fe008|but we've got good microphones.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
me070|right.|B
fe008|and another there is sort of an upper limit set on our bandwidth by the sampling rate.|S
fe008|but then that becomes|D
fe008|so adam's that|D
fe066|uhhuh.|B
fe008|then it becomes a matter of is that something that would be relevant to perceptual range.|S
fe008|and i didn't really have the sense that it would.|S
fe066|i didn't get that from him actually.|S
fe066|i felt like um he's basically saying that for our for all intents and purposes with this it's covering whatever sounds are necessary to be covered like everything.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe008|uhhuh.|S
fe008|good i i that was my impression also.|S
fe066|that's that's what i|D
fe008|it so we don't have that kind of reduction like you have on telephones.|S
fe008|and actually in the work that they were doing with the telephone corpora they did run into limitations.|S
fe008|and uh certain types that they when what their speech recognition approach.|S
fe008|is because of the of the filtering.|S
fe068|huh.|B
fe008|i mean it does seem like when i hear these things except for the distortion parts.|S
fe008|where the volume's too high or of course when the volume's too low|D
fe008|but that's a different problem.|S
fe008|um except for those cases it seems to me that it really is as if the person were speaking in my ear.|S
fe008|i don't feel that it's being reduced in any way.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe067|huh.|S
fe068|uhhuh.|B
fe069|yeah that's what it seems like.|S
fe066|yeah yeah i do too.|S
fe066|yeah.|S
fe008|yeah?|Q
fe008|and he was saying in the in the uh areas where you have clipping where it's recorded too high and and it starts to saturate and you have trouble.|S
fe066|right.|B
fe008|um i thought that was very interesting.|S
fe008|so bandwidth then gets gets actually wider instead of narrower.|S
fe008|because you have|D
fe008|um|F
fe008|uhoh!|S
fe008|you have these you still have the frequencies are represented.|S
fe008|but the energy distributions are thrown off.|S
fe008|and um in fact you have also some additional frequencies.|S
fe008|so you end up with a wider bandwidth functionally.|S
fe008|i mean|D
fe066|yeah so like you were saying like in the case of something with clipping.|S
fe008|but not helpful for speech.|S
fe066|does it were you saying that uh it it increases to or expands to accommodate that?|Q
fe066|or|D
fe008|no technically the bandwidth is wider than|D
fe066|no.|S
fe008|so it's actually paradoxical in a way.|S
fe008|because you usually think bandwidth better bandwidth is better.|S
fe066|oh.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|but in the cases of of distortion than you can end up with|D
fe066|right oh okay yeah.|S
fe008|uh|F
fe066|i see what you're saying.|S
fe008|a wider bandwidth which isn't useful in terms of understanding speech.|S
fe066|right.|B
me070|right.|S
fe068|huh.|B
fe008|so|F
fe069|i have a question.|S
fe008|yes.|S
fe069|in the some of the earlier meetings i guess there was a lot of spikes.|S
fe069|or what i called spikes.|S
fe008|yes.|S
fe069|i was wondering what that is.|S
fe069|i don't even know if it's relevant or useful to know.|S
fe069|but i'm just curious.|S
fe008|one source was there was a problem with a connection.|S
fe008|where the microphone went went into a box.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|i was trying trying to think of this as prior to|D
fe008|yes it was prior to the wireless.|S
fe008|there was a particular connection which wasn't wireless.|S
fe008|which was um mechanically bad in some some sense.|S
fe069|loose.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and if it got touched it would it would send an impulse.|S
fe066|oh.|B
fe067|huh.|B
fe008|in an uh an irrelevant non wanted artifact.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|huh.|B
fe069|because those ones sometimes were extraordinarily bad and|D
fe066|huh.|B
me070|painful.|S
me070|yeah.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|i agree absolutely painful.|S
me070|they were painful.|S
fe008|i agree.|S
fe066|uh|F
fe008|and that's that's you know i would watch the visual signal to avoid that.|D
me070|oh yeah.|B
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|it's like|D
fe068|yeah.|B
fe069|yeah and like not listen to them.|D
fe066|i do remember those actually.|S
me070|and then you see it.|S
me070|and off with the headphones.|S
fe068|yeah you could see it coming and you'd turn the volume down or something.|D
fe069|or just uh|D
fe066|yeah yeah yeah yeah i remember i had one one with that and it was just all the time.|S
fe069|yeah or like skip it entirely.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|oh yeah.|B
fe066|yeah.|B
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|yeah.|B
fe066|especially if they also got louder too and they hit it.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe008|oh!|D
fe066|it was just like whoahh!|S
fe008|yeah that's really awful.|S
fe008|you've noticed that those have gotten better over the intervening.|S
fe069|yes absolutely.|S
me070|oh yeah uhhuh.|S
fe066|yes.|S
fe008|good.|S
fe068|but sometimes you'll see like something coming up.|S
fe068|like uhoh.|S
fe068|someone's going to cough really loudly.|S
fe068|and i could tell because of the way it looks.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe068|or someone's about to laugh really loudly.|S
fe069|and so you turn it down.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|oh.|S
fe068|um yeah.|S
fe008|yeah yeah yeah.|B
fe068|and then you're just you've got like you know you're sort of like|D
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe066|take one off or something.|S
fe068|yeah.|F
fe069|no i think|D
fe067|huh.|B
me070|yeah.|B
fe068|so unless there's going to be some speech in there i don't think i need to listen that carefully.|S
fe069|i think that's really important.|S
fe069|yeah i think that's really important.|S
fe068|yeah.|B
fe069|because i generally have the volume turned up to above normal volume just so i can hear more clearly.|S
fe068|so|F
me070|uhhuh yeah.|B
fe066|right.|B
fe069|and if it's like that for someone screeching into the microphone than it would be really painful.|S
fe068|yeah.|B
fe066|right.|B
fe068|you could really hurt your ears yeah.|S
fe069|i think you could yeah.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe068|oh yeah.|S
fe008|i think so too.|S
fe067|huh.|B
fe068|so|F
fe008|yeah i|D
fe069|yeah that's|D
fe069|especially we have really good headphones.|S
fe008|when i realized|D
fe069|like|D
fe008|yeah when i realized i i meant to tell everyone to watch that visual signal.|S
fe008|because that's that's saved me a bunch of times.|S
fe068|gives some good clues.|S
fe068|yeah.|B
fe069|yeah i mean it's very useful in like all senses.|S
fe069|because|D
fe068|oh yeah yeah.|S
me070|yeah.|S
fe066|oh yeah.|S
fe008|yeah.|S
fe069|it's very good.|S
fe068|sometimes it doesn't pick up backchanneling though.|S
fe068|and so sometimes you have to um try to listen.|S
fe069|no.|S
fe069|or turn up|D
fe068|there's no visual.|S
fe068|but|F
fe068|yeah you have to the resolution.|S
fe068|right.|S
fe069|yeah or like|D
me070|right.|B
fe008|it might be useful to to talk about the interface for for a bit.|S
fe068|so|F
fe008|in terms of what it is that you like particularly and what you don't.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and uh that kind of thing.|S
me070|you know what i would think would be a really um neat feature for the interface?|Q
me070|some sort of backwards tab.|S
me070|where it could go backwards without you having to go up and do it manually.|S
fe008|ooh interesting.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe066|yeah.|S
me070|and you know press the button and juh-juh-juh-juh-juh-juh-juh.|S
fe067|huh.|B
me070|because if you miss something and you want to go back to it it's such a such a hassle.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe066|that's true.|S
me070|it'd be so nice if there was just some sort of like you know uh opposite of tab that you could hit that it would just sort of move backwards.|S
me070|there wouldn't even have to be any um|D
fe068|huh.|B
fe069|but it would play it backwards too.|S
me070|i know.|S
me070|it you wouldn't even have to have the audio.|S
me070|that's not i wouldn't i mean|D
fe069|but just to move back but not necessarily a whole timebin?|Q
fe068|just to jump it back.|S
me070|yeah.|S
fe008|interesting.|S
fe068|right because sometimes you'll hear it'll be in right in the middle of the timebin.|S
fe008|huh.|B
fe068|and you don't have to listen to the whole thing again.|S
fe066|right.|B
fe068|because you've already gotten the first part.|S
me070|right.|B
fe069|yeah.|B
fe067|huh.|B
me070|oh yeah yeah.|S
fe068|so you just want it to go back|D
fe068|i don't know.|S
me070|yeah some|D
fe066|and otherwise you have to drag it.|S
me070|yeah some timebins are humongous.|S
fe069|or otherwise drag it or like click on it.|S
me070|and if you miss it you know you've got to go back and find it.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me070|and dragging it and looking for it and you may not be able to see it even.|S
fe066|right.|B
fe069|yeah.|S
me070|you know.|S
fe068|that's true.|S
fe069|i think that would be useful.|S
fe068|huh yeah.|B
me070|yeah.|S
fe008|interesting idea.|S
fe008|i'll i'll i'll suggest that to the charer.|S
fe068|yeah the less you have to click on the mouse i think the faster you could go.|S
fe069|yeah because i noticed i started feeling like i was getting some sort of carpal tunnel issues.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe068|yeah you were having some wrist problems and stuff.|S
fe069|much better now that i have the keyboard tray.|S
fe068|right?|Q
fe069|but it was|D
fe068|yeah.|S
fe069|i think because i had my hand in one position using it all the time.|S
me070|huh.|B
fe069|and that i would it would crack a lot.|S
fe068|yeah ooh!|S
fe069|it was very weird.|S
fe067|huh.|B
fe069|but|D
fe066|yeah.|D
fe008|that's it's good to be careful about the mousing.|S
fe008|you were going to say?|Q
fe066|oh yeah um something um maybe i just don't know how to do this.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
fe066|but when i want to expand a timebin back|D
fe069|uhhuh.|B
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe066|or even forward.|S
fe066|i'll use the mouse.|S
fe066|the middle|D
fe008|how do you mean expand?|Q
fe008|what do you mean by expand?|Q
fe066|oh uh in terms of um if uh if it's it's if it's cut off.|S
fe066|like the beginning of an utterance.|S
fe008|okay.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe069|oh i see what you're saying.|S
fe008|okay okay.|S
fe066|i'll move it move the line back.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe066|and i usually just use the mouse.|S
fe066|how do you do that with the keyboard?|Q
me070|huh.|B
me070|really ? oh i do that with the keyboard.|S
fe069|well i would press tab.|S
fe068|i do that with the mouse yeah.|S
fe069|and listen to where i wanted it to stop.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe069|and then press return create a new timebin.|S
me070|return.|S
me070|and then|D
fe066|oh.|S
fe069|and then shift|D
me070|and then shift|D
fe069|shift what is it?|Q
me070|backspace.|S
fe066|oh okay so you just do it that way.|S
fe069|shift backspace to collapse it yeah.|S
me070|that's that's what i do.|S
fe066|okay okay.|S
me070|yeah.|B
me070|i do it all on the keyboard.|S
fe068|oh!|S
fe066|okay to me that's takes longer than to do it with the mouse.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
fe069|oh do you drag do you drag the line?|S
me070|oh really?|Q
fe066|because you can just click|D
fe008|yeah.|B
fe066|i just drag the line.|S
fe069|see i never i never do that for some reason.|S
me070|i don't do that either.|D
fe067|i didn't even even know you could do that.|S
fe008|i vary.|S
fe008|i i should it depends on how much i want to go back.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|and how certain the boundary is.|S
fe008|if i can see it if it's if i can see this thing's coming up and it's just so clear.|S
fe066|oh yeah that's true.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|right.|B
fe008|it's that mountain right there i can tell then|D
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|right then i'll drag it.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|yeah dragging is really efficient.|S
fe008|but if it's like a mess in there then it helps me to be able to locate it with the actual clicking.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe066|right.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe068|huh.|B
me070|right.|B
fe067|huh.|B
fe008|and then do this what you were just describing.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|but um|F
fe069|um one thing that's gotten me into problems a little bit is having the shift-backspace as the collapser.|S
fe066|uh yeah.|S
fe069|because i'll tend to delete things.|S
fe066|yeah.|B
fe069|or go too far or something.|S
fe069|or i'll be holding down shift because i want to type something as a capital.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe068|oh yeah.|B
fe066|yeah.|B
fe066|yep yep yep yep.|S
fe069|and then end up collapsing the timebins.|S
me070|and and then collapse it.|S
fe066|yep.|B
fe066|yep.|B
me070|i did that so much.|S
fe069|so it might be better to use a different keys or something.|S
fe008|oh that's annoying.|S
fe066|yep.|B
fe008|this if i were to|D
fe068|yeah.|B
fe008|if i were to add an option it might be to have an undo for that.|S
fe069|yeah yeah.|S
fe067|oh that'd be good that would be good.|S
fe066|yeah.|S
fe008|because i have had that happen.|S
me070|yeah that would be nice.|S
fe066|that would be great.|S
fe069|or just i mean|D
fe008|yeah good.|D
fe066|i've erased entire utterances before accidentally.|S
fe069|but or just to change the keys used you know for for that option.|S
me070|yeah i'm rather used to it now though.|S
fe069|i'm used to it too.|S
fe069|but i mean|D
me070|yeah.|B
fe066|but then when you go to type on your keyboard at home.|S
me070|uhhuh you're so scared!|S
fe066|do you do this too?|Q
fe066|i'm so scared.|S
fe066|like i i won't hold shift down|D
me070|yeah.|B
me070|to to hold shift down while you're backspacing?|Q
me070|like|D
fe066|i won't do it.|S
me070|yeah.|F
me070|you're typing capitals and you're backspacing and you're like oh take the shift off.|S
me070|i'll collapse everything.|S
fe066|yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.|S
fe066|i'm just like what am i doing.|S
me070|i totally do that now.|S
fe069|i don't think i'm that bad.|S
fe069|but|F
fe066|yeah yeah.|B
fe068|oh yeah i do find that the keyboard is different here than it is even at my for my school computer.|S
fe008|huh.|B
fe068|and so i'll i'll just be|D
fe068|if i was just at school and i come here it's just|D
me070|oh yeah.|S
fe068|or vice versa.|S
fe068|it's just uh it's like i'll i'll reach for one key and it'll do something completely different.|S
me070|or vice versa yeah.|S
fe068|and i have to just get used just get used to it again.|S
fe066|uhhuh.|B
me070|that backspace and the little|D
fe068|yeah the backspace is in the wrong place.|S
me070|and the yeah that little evil apostrophe that keeps showing up.|S
fe067|the little accent thingy.|S
fe067|right.|S
me070|i don't want you.|S
fe069|yeah i do that too.|S
fe068|oh yeah and then i'll keep i keep caps locking too.|S
fe008|oh.|B
fe068|because the caps-lock's in a different spot.|S
me070|oh yeah.|B
fe069|yeah.|B
fe068|so|F
fe067|huh.|B
fe066|oh.|B
fe008|how do you get i don't know the evil apostrophe?|Q
fe069|it's just right above the backspace.|S
me070|um yeah it's one of the backspaces on the keyboards that most of us are probably used to.|S
fe067|yeah.|B
fe008|oh oh!|S
me070|so you want to backspace and you get apostrophe apostrophe apostrophe apostrophe.|S
fe066|yeah yeah yeah yeah.|S
fe067|huh.|B
me070|yeah you're like no.|S
fe008|i see.|S
fe068|oh.|F
fe068|yeah i do that all the time.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|okay so this is the difference between the p.c. keyboard and the sun keyboard.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|so like i only have one i have one versus two of the others.|S
fe069|i think so.|S
me070|yeah.|B
fe066|yeah.|B
fe067|yeah.|B
fe069|did it|D
fe069|right.|S
fe008|is that right?|Q
me070|right i i'm used to it now too.|S
fe008|so it's|D
fe069|i'm actually used to|D
fe069|i'm used to the sun one i guess now.|S
fe008|okay.|S
fe066|yeah.|B
fe066|but then like i think there's a different keyboard on|D
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe066|i always forget|D
fe066|oh linguine than on um|D
fe008|there's|D
fe008|basmati?|Q
fe066|no the other one.|S
fe008|amaretto?|Q
fe066|amaretto.|S
fe008|okay.|S
fe069|amaretto has a different one.|S
fe069|linguine is basmati have the same.|S
fe066|right and it's and i always use i tend to use linguine.|S
fe069|right?|Q
fe066|but the last couple times like you've stolen linguine before i can get to it.|S
fe069|ooh!|S
fe066|i can get to it.|S
fe066|so i go onto amaretto.|S
fe066|which is fine.|S
fe066|but then like um it takes me a good like ten minutes to get reused to that keyboard.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|and so i keep|D
fe068|i don't know.|S
fe068|you seem very upset about it.|S
fe068|so we maybe we should trade.|S
fe066|no it's really okay.|S
fe066|but yeah i i i have noticed that i'll screw some stuff up like when i'm trying to get|D
fe008|so which|D
fe069|but just the beginning.|S
fe008|i i've forgotten which one is which.|S
fe008|so which one do you prefer?|Q
fe008|is it is it the so if we had a show of hands how many people would vote for the sun keyboard versus the|D
me070|okay.|B
fe008|so let's put it the other way.|S
fe008|how many people would not vote for the sun keyboard?|Q
fe008|would vote for the other one.|S
fe008|the p.c.p.c. keyboard.|S
fe069|which is the|D
fe066|the p. c?|Q
me070|the p.c. one?|Q
fe066|i would vote for the p.c.|S
fe069|the p.c. one is the amaretto one.|S
fe069|right?|Q
fe008|i don't know.|S
fe008|i i'm not sure.|S
fe008|it's the|D
fe066|yeah.|S
fe068|huh.|B
me070|i'm not sure which one is which.|S
fe066|or no.|S
fe068|yeah.|B
fe068|i just get used to it.|S
fe008|uhoh.|S
fe068|so|F
me070|yeah.|S
fe066|i like the linguine keyboard.|S
fe067|yeah.|S
me070|i mean like when i first had started working i would have definitely wanted the p.c. keyboard.|S
fe008|the linguine is okay.|S
fe066|that's all i know.|S
me070|but now i'm i'm just used to it.|S
fe008|you're|D
fe069|i prefer i prefer the one on linguine or basmati.|S
fe068|yeah.|B
fe069|i don't know what it's called.|S
fe008|okay let's do it that way.|S
fe067|uhhuh.|B
fe008|so so if we if we have a map of the room the one when you first walk in|D
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe068|is basmati.|S
fe069|oh.|S
fe066|to the left|D
fe008|the one on the left is that basmati?|Q
fe067|by the light switch yeah.|S
fe066|yep.|B
fe068|i believe that's correct yeah.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|okay.|S
fe068|linguine must be the one in the left hand corner.|S
fe008|and|D
me070|it's the one in in that corner right?|S
fe066|linguine is the one in the corner.|S
fe069|in the|D
me070|that that has the p.c.|S
me070|right?|D
fe069|yeah the one in the|D
fe008|and then the the far right corner as you walk in?|Q
me070|yeah yeah that's that one's got the the p.c. keyboard.|S
me070|and then the two on those sides have the um sun keyboard.|S
fe066|yeah so basically right as you walk in the door the one straight ahead of you is amaretto.|S
me070|right.|S
fe008|yep.|S
fe068|huh.|B
fe066|and the one to the left of that against the far corner is linguine.|S
fe008|good.|S
fe008|okay.|S
fe068|huh.|B
fe008|and the one close to you is basmati.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe066|right.|S
fe008|okay so now who would've|D
me070|yes.|S
fe008|so if you have a strong|D
fe008|now you're bi-keyboardal.|S
fe008|so|F
me070|uh yeah.|S
fe008|but|D
fe008|but um|F
fe066|nice.|S
fe008|who who would prefer the keyboard on linguine?|Q
fe008|okay we got two votes for linguine.|S
fe008|and who would prefer amaretto?|Q
fe008|amaretto.|S
fe008|so we got more more multi-keyboardal people.|S
fe067|ready.|S
fe068|i just have no preference.|S
fe008|well that's lovely.|S
fe067|yeah it doesn't really matter.|S
fe008|same here?|Q
me070|yeah.|D
fe068|yeah.|D
fe008|excellent.|S
fe067|yeah.|S
fe008|okay so|D
fe068|it just goofs me up for like maybe a minute.|S
fe068|and then i sort of get used to it.|S
me070|exactly exactly.|S
fe069|i i could get used to i could get used to it too.|S
fe066|yeah i could get used to it too.|S
fe008|okay.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe069|i just am very used to|D
fe068|huh.|B
fe066|right.|S
fe069|i don't know.|S
fe069|because i always use it.|S
fe008|i i see.|S
fe008|i i have experienced this keyboard conflict.|S
fe008|and with me the things that are confusing are where the control key is.|S
fe008|so i end up|D
fe069|huh.|B
fe008|pressing shifts and control keys whenever i want the other one whichever it is.|S
me070|oh that's true.|S
fe069|uhhuh uhhuh.|B
me070|i forgot about that one.|S
fe066|oh.|S
me070|yeah.|B
fe068|huh.|B
fe067|huh.|B
fe068|uhhuh.|B
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|i could easily put a p.c. keyboard in there if anyone had|D
fe008|i we already have one.|S
fe008|i could add another one.|S
me070|right.|B
fe008|we so you know maybe let me know if you want it to have it shifted.|S
me070|i'm|D
fe008|but um|F
fe008|okay.|S
fe008|that's good.|S
fe008|oh let me see.|S
fe008|so um i i wanted to um maybe comment a little more on the interface in terms of what aspects of it are helpful in this.|S
fe008|i know we had this interface for a time when people were doing marking of the numbers.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and um um|F
fe008|i've forgotten someone said that they could recognize a seven when they saw it they could see the the waveform and oh it's going to be a seven.|S
me070|oh wow.|S
fe066|oh yeah.|S
fe069|i i remember recognizing certain numbers.|S
fe069|i huh i don't remember which ones.|S
fe069|but i think it was maybe|D
fe069|well i could recognize when there was a fricative at the beginning of a number for some reason.|S
fe069|it was like a little bit of energy or whatever you call it.|S
fe069|and then it grew really big.|S
fe069|so like four and five and three all had this same characteristic.|S
fe069|and six and seven both had the same characteristics to their in the beginnings.|S
me070|huh.|B
fe069|but six and eight.|S
fe069|eight um i remember tended that people tended to not pronounce the last t. .|S
fe008|oh.|S
fe069|and when they did it was slightly farther away from the rest of the word than you would have expected.|S
fe066|uhhuh.|B
fe069|same with six.|S
fe069|the x. well the k.s. or whatever at the end.|S
fe068|huh.|B
me070|huh.|B
fe069|but|F
fe069|yeah.|S
fe069|that was a that was really interesting to notice that.|S
fe069|uh|F
fe069|it's a very different interface though.|S
fe069|i mean it seems very strange.|S
fe008|uhhuh it is different.|S
fe008|well it it would it had the benefit of it|D
fe008|so this this was to handle the digits uh only.|S
me070|okay.|B
fe008|which is what you figure.|S
fe008|and um did you i thought you might have done that joel.|S
fe008|did you also?|Q
me070|nn huh no.|S
fe008|so two people did that um i thought.|S
fe068|i did it a little.|S
fe008|did you do it?|Q
fe008|i thought so.|S
fe008|good good.|S
fe068|just a little bit.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe068|yeah.|B
fe008|okay.|F
fe069|yeah i only did it a little bit too.|S
fe068|yeah what happened to that?|Q
fe068|you just stopped doing it?|Q
fe068|or|D
fe008|well i think that we'll bring it back.|S
fe068|oh okay.|S
fe008|the|D
me070|this was a different interface entirely?|Q
fe069|yeah.|S
fe008|uh adam wrote this as uh using the same uh computer language as channeltrans is written in.|S
me070|uhhuh.|D
fe008|and what it would do is present you with the digit string that the person was supposed to have said.|S
fe008|and then you would listen to it.|S
fe008|and the|D
fe008|there were two parts to the task.|S
fe008|one of them was to see if that's what they actually said.|S
fe008|and to indicate you know in the transcribe errors of it.|S
fe066|huh.|B
me070|huh.|B
fe008|and then the other aspect was to tighten the timebins.|S
fe008|and those data were actually used in some analyses which showed uh very very good results.|S
fe068|right.|B
fe068|good.|S
me070|oh wow.|S
fe008|and so it shows|D
fe008|i mean it's it's useful.|S
fe008|this is this is why we do these digits.|S
fe008|it's a nice standard task.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and you have lots of different voices.|S
fe066|uhhuh.|B
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and it's very clear.|S
fe008|you know what the canonical answer is when a person says a number.|S
fe008|um at least most of the time you know what number it was they said.|S
fe008|so its|D
me070|right.|B
fe008|ground truth as they call it is very clear.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
me070|huh.|B
fe066|right.|B
fe008|so|F
fe008|but i it was um really rather minimal.|S
fe008|i mean i i like that interface.|S
fe008|very efficient.|S
fe008|and really is um i think that we'll probably use it for getting the digits refined in terms of their timebins.|S
me070|huh.|B
fe069|if i remember correctly it seemed to be very efficient in the key strokes that you used to do certain things.|S
fe068|uhhuh.|B
fe069|i can't remember what they were now.|S
fe069|but i just remember that it was once you learned them it was very neat and concise.|S
fe069|and like|D
fe008|excellent.|S
fe069|couple keys that you used.|S
fe068|yeah the hardest thing'd be finding them.|S
fe069|huh.|B
fe068|because i would get the whole i'd get the whole transcript of the meeting.|S
fe008|oh that's right.|S
fe068|and you had to find them.|S
fe068|you'd have to find where the digits were.|S
fe069|oh.|S
fe068|and they'd usually be at the end somewhere.|S
me070|oh wow.|S
fe066|oh.|B
fe068|but you had to figure out where the heck in the meeting to to look for them.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|that's right.|D
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe068|so|F
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|i also think that wasn't this a stage where some of these meetings hadn't been transcribed.|S
fe008|so i don't think you could use a string search right?|S
fe069|yeah.|D
fe008|i mean i was trying to remember how that worked.|S
me070|huh.|D
fe008|but it was difficult finding them for some reason.|S
fe068|yeah.|S
fe069|yep.|B
fe008|well it was also like you|D
fe068|yeah the interface was different.|S
fe068|i i yeah.|S
fe068|it was it was more complicated.|S
fe008|that's a down side.|S
fe068|but anyway.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe068|than what it would be now.|S
fe068|so|F
fe008|actually you you also did a different type of transcription uh with respect to um our sister project.|S
fe008|the smartkom project.|S
fe008|which involved listening to people who were supposed to be wandering through germany.|S
me070|oh right.|B
fe008|and this is supposed to be something that would be useful in developing an interface to help them find their way.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|so um someone else did that too.|S
fe008|i've forgotten who who else did that.|S
fe008|did anybody else here do that?|Q
fe008|okay.|S
fe069|i feel like i did a little checking or something on that.|S
fe008|actually i think you might have done this also as i think about it.|S
fe069|yeah i don't know i don't remember actually transcribing it.|S
fe069|but i remember listening to.|S
fe008|oh.|F
fe008|uhhuh so actually we started with the words.|S
me070|yeah.|B
fe008|and it was a matter then of trying to find the most efficient way to match the words up with the with the actual sounds.|S
fe008|because they were reading from a script.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe069|right.|S
fe066|huh.|B
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and then there was some conversation in addition that that um needed to be transcribed.|S
fe067|huh.|B
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|but um|F
fe008|yeah.|S
fe008|one thing that you learn with this interface right away is that if you have really really really long utterances it's extremely inefficient to do anything.|S
fe067|huh.|B
fe008|because you end up|D
fe008|if you try to go up in the transcript you end up with this huge huge space of time.|S
fe066|uhhuh.|B
me070|yep.|S
fe008|and things covering several screens.|S
fe008|and it's just horribly inefficient.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|yeah.|B
fe008|so|F
me070|yeah.|B
fe069|one thing that i still can't figure out with the interface.|S
fe069|it does this sometimes.|S
fe069|but other times it doesn't.|S
fe069|is when you click on|D
fe069|you know there's a bar above where this sound wave is that has um the|D
fe069|it has a little bar of where the meeting is.|S
fe069|like in|D
fe008|yes.|B
fe068|uhhuh.|B
fe069|and it goes along as you're listening to the meeting.|S
fe069|and then it ends up the end.|S
fe069|and if you click on that bar to the right of that little marker then it moves forward.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe069|if you click on the left it moves back.|S
fe069|but sometimes it moves two frames or two screens.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe066|huh.|B
fe008|oh yes.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe067|huh.|B
fe008|i've noticed that.|S
fe069|and sometimes it doesn't.|S
fe008|i think that's totally dependent on how you have the resolution set.|S
fe008|so that little tiny thing.|S
fe069|really?|Q
fe008|and if i increase the resolution so it's spread out a bit more then i seem to have more control over it.|S
fe069|okay.|S
fe008|but i don't have|D
me070|huh.|B
fe069|because i noticed that a few times it would do it it would move twice|D
fe066|that kind of makes sense.|S
fe008|yes.|S
fe069|and then in sometimes it wouldn't.|S
fe066|because|D
fe066|yeah|D
fe069|and maybe maybe i had resolution set differently.|S
fe066|because yeah if the the resolution if it's moving too slowly then like if you were to click on some place then it makes sense that it would get kind of confused.|S
fe069|or i|D
fe066|but if it's moving quickly seems that it's covering more ground faster.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe066|so i don't know.|S
fe008|i'm going to report that to him.|S
fe008|because i i've i know|D
fe008|that's one of the reasons why when i uh suggested to visual scan the record that i suggested doing it by clicking on the right of the of that navigation bar you're mentioning.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|or actually clicking on the right of the sound wave and then letting it run past the boundary.|S
fe069|right.|B
fe008|because i had the same problem.|S
fe069|yeah that's what i tend to do is i use a soundwave.|S
fe008|it's|D
fe069|but if i'm trying to scan through a long period of what appears to be silence sometimes i'll ry and be try to scan it.|S
fe008|because you always know|D
fe008|yes.|B
fe008|yeah much more|D
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe069|but i can't.|S
fe069|because|D
fe008|because you end up missing entire frames.|S
fe069|it skips yeah.|S
fe069|so then i end up clicking on the arrow they have the arrow at the far right.|S
fe008|i was surprised by that.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
fe008|yes okay okay.|S
fe069|and so i use that sometimes.|S
fe008|so on the on that on that bar you were describing clicking.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe069|at the far right and far left there's a little arrow that allows you to go like second by second or something.|S
fe008|okay.|S
me070|i didn't know about that.|S
fe069|i don't know.|S
me070|really?|Q
fe069|not second by second.|S
fe069|but little bit by bit yeah.|S
fe008|so is this the arrow on the right?|Q
me070|oh.|S
fe008|it would be underneath that little resolution bar?|Q
fe008|i mean it's like in that cluster up there.|S
fe069|um it's not on the resolution part.|S
fe069|it's where you have it's where you have the marker of where you are in the meeting.|S
fe069|so you have this bar uh and then you have a time marker that moves along.|S
fe069|say you're halfway through the meeting it's going to be halfway along the line.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe008|i have to do something visually.|S
fe008|so my i would say you have the transcript screen.|S
fe008|and then you have a bar.|S
fe008|i think you're referring to this bar aren't you?|S
fe069|i think|D
fe069|yeah.|S
fe008|and then there's like this little resolution changer.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe069|it's|D
fe069|yeah.|S
fe008|and then down here you have the soundwave.|S
fe008|and then something down here.|S
fe069|exactly.|S
me070|oh.|D
fe008|and then you got the the different channels come out.|S
fe069|so right at the right and left of that|D
fe008|so right in here you have this bar that you move and as as you go along it|D
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|okay so is are you saying?|D
me070|oh that!|S
me070|yeah.|B
fe008|you saying that there's an arrow right here?|Q
fe069|yeah.|S
fe008|okay and then there's an arrow right here?|S
fe069|yeah yeah.|S
fe008|okay.|S
fe008|so you can|D
fe069|exactly.|S
me070|oh does|D
me070|that doesn't|D
fe066|i usually just don't use that i think.|S
me070|yeah that skips|D
me070|oh is that what you're talking about?|Q
fe066|oh.|B
me070|if you use that|D
fe067|huh.|B
me070|i've never used been able to use that.|S
me070|because it i feel like it skips such huge portions.|S
fe069|maybe we have resolution set totally different.|S
fe067|yeah.|S
fe069|because i noticed when jen and i have totally different resolutions.|S
me070|maybe we do.|S
fe069|because hers moves so much quicker than mine.|S
fe066|i tend to make it move fast.|S
me070|oh i i i yeah i wouldn't|D
fe069|which means it's more stretched out right?|S
me070|i wouldn't use that unless i was trying to get to a whole different part of the|D
fe066|right right right right.|S
fe069|yeah i usually have it set to where it has um point five second intervals on the numbers.|S
fe068|right that's when i use it too.|S
me070|yeah.|B
fe066|huh.|B
fe008|oh that's interesting!|S
fe008|i haven't paid attention to the numbers.|S
fe008|i sort of like visually|D
fe008|it helps me to have it be separated enough that i could find a new breaking point if i needed it.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|yeah that's the reason i separate it out.|S
fe069|yeah i|D
me070|right.|S
fe066|yeah.|B
fe069|i do too.|S
fe069|but sometimes if it gets too too for me too stretched out um i'll tend to think that there's a break in between a pause inside of a word or something.|S
fe008|expanded?|Q
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe066|oh yes.|S
fe069|i don't know.|S
fe066|because the uh the waveform becomes too stretched out.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe066|right.|B
fe066|because|D
fe069|so i prefer it to be a little bit tighter.|S
fe066|yeah.|B
fe066|it's nice to have|D
fe069|but i'll stretch i'll stretch it in a particular place if i need to or something.|S
fe066|right.|S
fe066|a sort of like happy medium so you can make sure that the waveform has its like shape.|S
me070|uh right.|B
me070|uhhuh.|D
fe069|yeah.|S
fe066|yeah.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|now i know what you're talking about.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe069|that's kind of interesting though.|S
fe066|yeah.|S
fe008|well we're coming kind of close to the end of our time here.|S
fe008|um i did ask about dessert.|S
fe008|and they told me it was ice cream.|S
fe008|and it doesn't save well.|S
fe008|so i mean|D
me070|oh.|B
fe069|well if there's any left we can grab it.|S
fe068|if there was pie again|D
fe008|that's right.|S
fe068|if there was those tarts again i'd be like set us aside some there.|S
fe069|ooh those were good.|S
me070|huh.|B
fe069|yeah.|B
fe068|but|F
fe008|yeah there's some those are those are nice.|S
fe068|i'm not a big ice cream fan.|S
fe066|really?|Q
fe066|oh.|S
fe068|nah.|S
me070|no?|Q
fe008|but i did i was thinking you know it is interesting to me to think about how each each of us have sampled different meetings.|S
fe008|and yet it's intriguing to me to think that if i were to describe someone's characteristics in terms of their speech patterns i bet you we would all agree on who it who it was.|S
fe066|uhhuh.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|S
fe008|you know.|D
fe008|i think that's so interesting.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
me070|yeah.|S
fe008|yeah it's it's a statement of speaker style of course.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|but|F
fe069|and also that we can i don't know that we have this shared realm of knowledge kind of.|S
fe069|and can laugh about things that other people would not understand whatsoever.|S
fe069|or|D
fe069|you know?|Q
fe066|uhhuh.|S
fe066|the little intricacies and idiosyncracies of people's voices.|S
fe069|yeah yeah i mean it's really cool.|S
fe066|and|F
fe069|yeah or even just about what we were talking about with the technical part you know the interface.|S
me070|yeah.|B
fe066|right.|S
fe069|i don't know.|S
fe008|do you have any favorite parts of these meetings?|Q
fe008|things that you|D
fe008|i mean we we talked briefly about this last time.|S
fe068|when people get really loopy.|S
fe068|and start telling lots of jokes i think.|S
fe066|yeah.|B
fe068|i enjoy always transcribing those sections.|S
fe008|is this do you think this is usually toward the end of the meeting?|Q
fe008|or does it vary?|Q
fe008|because it could.|S
fe068|it's yeah it seems to be more at the end.|S
fe008|the the person.|S
fe066|eah depends on the person.|S
fe067|or in the beginning.|S
fe068|like|D
fe067|the very beginning.|S
fe069|yeah in the very beginning.|S
fe068|yeah yeah.|S
me070|yeah.|D
fe008|okay.|S
fe068|yeah they'll be joking around.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|yeah that's true.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|do you have a favorite group that you that you like?|Q
fe008|i don't i don't want to cause any partisanship here.|S
fe008|but|F
fe068|wait a favorite what?|Q
fe008|a a a favorite type of meeting that you like.|S
fe008|or um or|D
fe068|oh you mean like uh like like um meeting recorder as opposed to e.d.u. as|D
fe068|like those groups?|Q
fe008|it whichever.|S
fe008|that way.|S
fe008|or or a nature of a meeting.|S
fe068|oh.|S
fe008|or|D
fe069|i prefer ones that are somewhat linguistically related.|S
fe066|yeah.|S
fe008|okay.|S
fe069|because it's more interesting for me.|S
me070|yeah i like those.|S
fe066|i don't like the technical ones.|S
fe066|because i don't understand what they're talking about.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe069|exactly and it's really hard|D
fe066|and so i'm just|D
fe066|yeah and i'm sitting there bored.|S
fe066|because i i really have no concept of what they're talking about.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|yeah.|B
fe066|so i'm going okay.|S
fe066|i'm just going to listen to you.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|uhhuh uhhuh.|B
me070|yeah the ones that where they're talking about linguistic things though are great.|S
fe066|yeah.|B
fe069|i|D
me070|i love those.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|i like those.|D
fe008|those are e. would these be the e.d.u. meetings?|Q
fe008|that's what i think.|S
fe008|is that true?|Q
fe066|the ones with liz and you.|S
me070|uhhuh.|S
fe066|yeah.|S
me070|yeah.|S
fe008|okay.|S
fe069|yeah you guys do some in the in the meeting recorder ones there's some talk of|D
fe069|i don't know.|S
fe069|discourse stuff.|S
fe069|i think it's really fun too to listen to when you give reports on transcription.|S
fe008|oh really?|Q
fe008|oh i'm really?|Q
fe069|yeah because there are always people like you know talking bad about the transcribers.|S
fe008|oh i'm glad.|S
fe069|and just making fun of|D
fe066|yeah.|B
fe069|and so it's really funny.|S
fe069|i don't know.|S
fe066|yeah.|B
fe066|i that's why i like johno.|S
fe069|it's really funny to listen to.|S
fe068|i've never heard anyone make fun of transcribers.|S
fe069|you haven't?|Q
fe066|really?|Q
fe066|oh it's so funny.|S
fe068|no!|S
fe008|oh johno does a lot of that.|S
fe068|when you guys were saying that last week i was like never heard that.|S
fe066|yeah.|S
fe066|that's why i like listening to him.|S
fe069|it's really funny.|S
fe066|he's always making fun of transcribers.|S
fe008|it would be a kick yeah in a uh in a good natured way.|S
fe066|yeah yeah yeah.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|it would be really fun to have a collage of all these things like well the transcribers|D
fe008|so rer-rer-rer-rer.|S
fe008|and then be some horrible thing the transcriber's going to have trouble with this.|S
fe066|yeah yeah yeah.|S
fe008|did you hear the meeting where the guy was doing um clicks like from african languages?|Q
fe068|yes.|S
me070|oh my.|S
fe066|oh my god!|S
fe008|wasn't that a kick?|Q
fe069|no.|S
fe068|i did that.|S
fe066|no.|S
fe008|that was really a kick.|S
fe068|and whistles.|S
fe068|he was it i you must have been there was a meeting where there was this guy.|S
fe068|he was making these funky sounds.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
fe068|and making funny whistles.|S
fe008|yep.|B
fe068|and you must have been sitting next to him.|S
fe008|i was exactly.|S
fe068|because you sort of engaged him in a conversation about it.|S
fe008|exactly so.|S
fe068|and he was like yeah i can make dogs uh raise their ears.|S
fe008|exactly.|S
fe008|exactly!|S
fe068|because i can whistle so high.|S
fe069|wow.|S
fe068|and you were like that's fascinating.|S
fe068|i remember that meeting.|S
fe068|i thought it was pretty funny.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe069|i think it's funny when there's little side conversations like that that happen at the same time too.|S
fe068|yeah.|B
fe069|i think those are interesting.|S
fe068|yeah.|B
fe069|and i think it's really cool when people.|S
fe069|start getting really excited about something or angry about something.|S
fe068|uhhuh.|B
fe069|because then they tend to interrupt each other a lot.|S
fe069|and|F
fe069|i don't know.|S
fe069|i mean i remember one where one person um was really trying to get something out really really desperately.|S
fe069|and he kept getting interrupted by like three three other people.|S
fe069|and he was like|D
fe066|oh.|D
fe069|and it was i mean it was kind of sad.|S
fe069|but it was like also really interesting to watch.|S
fe069|or to listen to.|S
fe069|both.|S
fe008|have have you noticed that sometimes you have these a a greater frequency of speech errors i think during times of of overlap?|Q
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|which which is you can just tell a person's monitoring at two levels.|S
fe066|yeah.|S
fe067|huh.|B
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and it's it's difficult.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe069|they're like just trying really hard to get it out before they get interrupted or something.|S
fe066|right.|B
me070|yeah.|B
fe069|i don't know.|S
fe066|i like transcribing you.|S
fe066|because you're very polite.|S
fe008|oh thank you!|S
fe066|no really.|S
fe066|you're always like well i was just thinking about this.|S
fe066|and maybe this might be if|D
fe066|i uh you know.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|it's just it's just kind of cute.|S
fe066|because everybody's like oh well okay.|S
fe066|and they'll just listen to you you know.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|they don't interrupt you.|S
fe066|they're just like well okay.|S
fe066|it's kind of neat.|S
fe069|yep.|B
fe008|thank you.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
fe008|let's see have you one of the things that i found is is um surprisingly difficult these days is to is to get certain electronic sounds to try and describe them?|S
fe069|huh.|B
fe008|have i was thinking about that the other day.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|it was like it's like|D
fe008|you know|F
fe008|someone in one of these e.d.u. meetings they have a laptop.|S
fe008|and they hit the thing.|S
fe008|and the and there's an error screen that comes up.|S
fe008|and it has this doink kind of sound.|S
fe008|and it|D
fe067|huh.|B
fe066|right right.|S
fe008|what is that?|Q
fe008|it's not a beep.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|it's not a bell.|S
fe008|it's not it's not a dong.|S
fe008|it's not a|D
fe008|i mean you there're all these words that i could imagine.|S
fe008|and so it's like it's a tinny kind of electronic sound that comes up when you make an error with your laptop.|S
fe008|and that's that's not really very helpful.|S
fe067|i wonder if like microsoft has a word for it.|S
fe066|now i'm now i'm just wondering how they're going to transcribe you saying that.|S
fe069|yes.|S
fe008|oh you mean the voice quality?|S
fe008|the the shift in|D
fe066|the doink.|S
fe067|bling.|S
fe008|oh that thing.|S
fe066|yeah i know.|S
fe008|oh|D
me070|now you did it again!|S
me070|stop torturing them!|S
fe066|no!|S
fe067|let's not make things hard on ourselves later.|S
fe069|i know.|S
me070|yeah.|D
fe008|yeah well and then you know there are these other things that i think are really interesting.|S
fe008|like the vocal changes in character.|S
fe008|people shifting into a kind of a comic voice.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|or sort of a mock this or mock that.|S
fe068|huh.|B
fe067|huh.|B
me070|huh.|B
fe008|you know the sighing.|S
fe008|and the oh no.|S
fe008|you know it's it's uh there are lot's of nuances which we uh which we use very often.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|comic words and things like that.|S
fe069|you know|D
fe008|and|D
fe067|huh.|B
me070|sorry.|S
fe008|yeah.|S
fe069|sorry to i just remembered one thing that really was you needed.|S
fe008|yeah.|D
fe069|i think it was you that pointed out the problem.|S
fe069|like you needed to be at the meeting to be able to transcribe correctly the noise.|S
fe069|i think it was adam was making this really strange noise.|S
fe069|and apparently he was pretending|D
fe008|eech-eech or something.|S
fe069|he was like pretending to screw something into his head.|S
fe008|whee-whee.|S
fe067|what?|D
fe069|was that what it was?|Q
fe008|yes it was one of these it was this kind of deal.|D
me070|oh yeah i had that one.|S
fe069|yeah yeah.|S
me070|oh yeah.|B
fe008|yes oh yes.|S
fe008|and he got to transcribe this meeting.|S
me070|yeah.|S
fe008|and there was all this meta stuff about|D
me070|that was fun.|S
fe008|because i was giving a report on what the comments were.|S
fe008|and it was one of these was this.|S
fe008|so|F
fe069|uhhuh.|B
me070|yeah.|B
fe008|whee-whee is what he said.|S
fe008|and he was going like this at the time.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe066|joel's like i am not amused.|S
me070|i don't even want to like try to repeat what he said.|S
me070|because i don't want to put the transcriber through it again.|S
fe008|yes that's right.|S
fe008|let's just|D
me070|but they actually had a big list of like things that people had transcribed.|S
me070|and then they were reading one them one by one.|S
me070|and being like what's this.|S
me070|this.|S
me070|you know and then doing the sounds.|S
fe066|aw.|S
me070|and then this sound must be this sound.|S
fe069|oh.|B
fe069|oh wow.|S
me070|this sound must be this.|S
fe069|i had one like that where they were describing the different qualities of uhhuh and uh and uah.|S
fe069|and like what e.h. is versus u.h. versus a.h.|S
me070|i had yeah i had one like that too.|S
fe068|yeah.|S
fe067|huh.|B
fe008|oh man.|S
fe069|that was really hard.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe069|that's really interesting.|S
me070|i had|D
me070|yeah.|F
me070|i had one where they were just they were just like talking about each word you know.|S
me070|and they were saying they were just describing the word over and over again.|S
me070|and just the the quotes around the word were driving me crazy when they knowing.|S
me070|when to put the quotes and when|D
me070|and then they were talking about like the difference between uh when it's a or when it's uh.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|and at some point they were saying it so much i didn't know how to transcribe it anymore.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|yeah.|B
me070|i was like i don't know if you're saying a or uh anymore.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|right.|B
fe068|oh yeah.|S
fe008|you did an excellent job.|S
fe008|that was really it was like transcription a meta-transcription and meta meta meta.|S
me070|oh thank you.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe068|yeah cool.|S
fe008|it's really.|D
me070|it was fun.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|you know i'm really interested in this topic.|S
fe008|would it be a problem if we continued a little bit longer on this?|Q
fe008|or do you need to do people need to leave?|Q
fe008|i don't want to keep you longer than|D
fe066|uhhuh.|B
me070|i'm fine.|S
fe067|i can stay.|S
fe069|i don't have to be anywhere until five.|S
fe068|sure.|S
fe008|are we okay?|Q
fe069|so|F
fe008|oh okay we won't be that long i don't think.|S
fe068|no.|S
fe069|good.|S
fe068|sure.|D
fe008|but but i really appreciate it.|S
me070|okay.|D
fe008|this is just really it's so interesting to me the the specific experiences of of having encountered these data in this way.|S
fe008|does um did anybody else want to say anything about|D
fe068|i mean just weird things like before|D
fe068|like i had kind of a weird thing happen.|S
fe068|and we'd talked about it.|S
fe068|it was when i'd first started working on the project i got this discussion where|D
fe068|this was before we had the different channels.|S
fe068|and um dan ellis it was when dan ellis was still here.|S
fe008|yes.|B
fe068|so it was like kind of early on right?|S
fe068|and um|F
fe068|he everyone's talking.|S
fe068|and then all of the sudden you hear dan talking to someone else.|S
fe068|and it's different people that you'd never heard before.|S
fe068|and and what he had done is he had left the room to|D
fe068|he'd and he had brought the microphone with him.|S
fe066|oh no!|S
fe068|and this is without the channelized interface.|S
fe068|so you you have no idea.|S
fe008|oh my gosh.|S
fe069|oh man.|S
me070|oh wow.|S
fe068|you think everyone's just become schizophrenic or something.|S
fe069|oh|D
fe068|and they're all like in they're own world or something.|S
fe068|because then all of the sudden he's talking about a he needs a copy machine.|S
fe068|and i and i'm just assuming well he's still in the room.|S
fe066|oh|D
fe068|and what the heck's he talking about.|S
me070|wow.|S
fe068|but just sort of just weird things like that.|S
fe068|and um yeah he had just left the room.|S
fe068|and gone and made a copy.|S
fe068|and he still had his microphone on.|S
fe068|and then you could hear the the the the women behind the desk talking to him.|S
fe068|and just sort of stuff like that.|S
fe068|it was just really bizarre.|S
fe068|so|F
fe069|that's really funny.|S
fe068|anyway just sort of weird things like that.|S
fe008|well it is there's another case where i ran across like of that type.|S
fe008|um when i was sitting here and we were doing|D
fe008|this was like one of the first meetings i ever participated in.|S
fe008|and and dan was adjusting something here.|S
fe008|and adam was in the next room.|S
fe008|and um adam says so i'll come in here and check the levels.|S
fe008|and and he says something.|S
fe008|and dan says no.|S
fe008|and it sounds like he's saying no to adam.|S
fe008|and it was if if if so this would have been extremely rude.|S
fe067|huh.|B
fe008|but the thing and and the reason that it would be rude is because you don't have this information from hearing all these equalized volume channels.|S
fe066|uhhuh.|B
fe069|right.|B
fe008|you don't know that they're not participating in the same conversation at all.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|yeah.|B
fe068|yeah.|B
fe008|it really is strange.|S
fe068|yeah.|B
fe008|it lead us it if we|D
fe068|so|F
fe008|it is true that this is kind of an artificial.|S
fe008|and um|D
fe008|discourse aspect.|S
fe008|the mixed channel is artificial.|S
fe008|because we're boosting it in order to make everything audible.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe067|huh.|F
fe066|it's interesting because like um when i'm working late at night i actually don't feel so lonely.|S
fe008|but|F
fe066|because there's so many voices in my head.|S
fe008|you mean when you leave here?|Q
fe008|when you're somewhere else.|S
fe066|no no while i while i'm working here.|S
fe008|no no okay.|S
fe066|it's like nine o'clock.|S
fe066|and nobody's here except for me.|S
fe066|and i'm like you know i don't feel so lonely.|S
fe069|oh yeah.|B
fe066|because there are like eight people talking to me all at once.|S
fe066|i'm like wow.|S
fe008|how about these meetings when where there are like eight speakers in one meeting?|Q
fe008|are those what are those like?|Q
fe066|takes a long time.|S
fe008|are|D
fe068|they take longer to do.|S
fe069|it takes a long time yeah.|S
fe067|huh.|B
fe008|okay.|S
me070|yeah.|S
fe068|in a way they're more fun though.|S
fe066|takes a long time.|D
fe069|yeah.|S
fe068|there's just more variety.|S
fe069|i tends i you know what i noticed is it tends to have a still a dominant group of speakers.|S
fe066|sometimes.|S
fe069|and then there are two or three people generally who don't talk at all.|S
fe067|huh.|B
fe066|yeah.|B
fe068|who won't talk.|S
fe069|except to say their digits or something.|S
fe069|or who|D
fe068|and to breathe.|S
fe067|yeah.|B
fe069|or to breathe and cough and sniff and whatever.|S
fe066|right.|S
fe067|oh god.|S
fe068|there'll be lots of breathing yeah.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe069|yeah but i i think that still overall you're going to have probably three or four or five dominant speakers.|S
fe066|one thing i noticed is that like|D
fe066|uhhh there was this one meeting i was transcribing there were nine nine speakers.|S
fe066|and by the end of it i was so entirely sick of listening to the same conversation all over again.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe066|nine times in slow mo.|S
fe069|exactly.|S
me070|definitely.|S
fe066|i was going nuts.|S
fe066|i was like i cannot take this anymore.|S
fe066|i can't listen to this anymore.|S
fe066|oh my god.|S
fe008|i had that same reaction.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|absolutely and sometimes these are meetings i participated in.|S
fe008|it's like|D
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe069|so you've this is like the tenth time for you then.|S
fe066|i swear it's like it's like a bad dream.|S
fe008|that's that's right.|S
fe066|it's like this is this is keep this keeps happening to me.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|never changes.|S
fe008|i'm going to check outside to make sure that we're okay with the um|D
fe069|oh okay.|S
fe066|oh okay.|S
fe068|did you guys ever|D
fe068|when this happened to me when i first started transcribing.|S
fe068|because i had never really transcribed stuff like this before.|S
fe008|is it okay if we stay for another half hour in this room?|Q
fe068|but um|F
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|good thanks.|S
fe068|i would leave here.|S
fe068|and i would go out and do my daily business.|S
fe068|and i would hear people speaking to me.|S
fe066|yeah.|B
fe068|and i would transcribe them in my head.|S
fe066|yes yeah yeah yeah oh yeah.|S
fe069|oh man.|S
me070|oh yeah that's fun.|S
fe068|i'd imagine what i would type.|S
fe069|yeah yeah.|S
fe067|huh.|B
fe068|it went away like maybe after a couple of weeks.|S
fe066|yeah.|B
me070|oh really?|Q
fe068|but it was just bizarre.|S
fe066|i still do that i still do that.|S
me070|i still do that.|S
fe067|no i|D
fe067|yeah.|B
fe068|really?|Q
fe069|occasionally.|S
me070|yeah.|B
fe066|yeah.|S
fe069|like on the bus or something when i'm bored.|S
fe066|yep or like i'll think|D
fe067|right it's something you're not interacting with.|S
fe068|oh no for me it was unconscious.|S
fe067|you're just listening.|S
fe069|oh really?|Q
fe068|it was i didn't mean for to be doing it.|S
fe069|oh okay.|S
fe066|no yeah yeah.|S
me070|oh oh.|S
fe068|it would just it was an intrusion.|S
fe067|uhhuh.|B
fe069|oh that's funny.|S
fe068|um not a not a bad intrusion.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe069|yeah.|S
fe068|but|F
fe068|not something i was sort of volitionally sort of|D
fe069|huh that's interesting.|S
fe066|i would also be really aware of how i was speaking.|S
me070|huh.|B
fe068|yes!|S
fe066|because i also tend|D
fe066|like we were talking about so.|S
fe066|i do that.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe066|i'll end utterances with so or and.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|and it'll just be a trailing off and i'll think man i would be such a pain in the butt to transcribe.|S
fe068|yeah!|B
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe067|huh.|B
fe068|yeah!|S
fe066|like i just uh i|D
fe066|yeah.|F
fe066|i'll i'll do the same thing as you do.|S
fe066|and i i'll listen to somebody and his or her speech will be particularly idiosyncratic.|S
fe068|yeah yeah.|B
fe066|and i'll go wow i just i'm glad i'm not transcribing him or her.|S
fe069|yeah i noticed a lot of my speech i don't know i wouldn't call them errors i guess disfluencies a lot more once when i started transcribing.|S
fe069|i just noticed and in people in general that people break up their speech interestingly.|S
fe067|huh.|B
fe068|yeah.|S
fe066|right.|B
fe068|yeah.|B
me070|huh.|B
fe066|i'm amazed sometimes that we manage to communicate.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe069|actually.|S
fe066|you know because people will say just like you know monosyllabic little grunts and squeaks and things.|S
fe069|i think that shows a lot of i think that shows a lot of how um it's not all acoustic.|S
fe066|and it means something.|S
fe069|i mean there's other things involved.|S
fe066|right.|B
fe069|eye contact.|S
fe069|body language.|S
fe066|right.|B
fe069|gesture.|S
fe069|whatever.|S
me070|right.|B
fe008|that raises a question.|S
fe008|um do you think that um you would have been considerably helped if we had had video tapes of these things?|Q
fe068|oh sure.|S
fe066|yes.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe008|okay.|S
fe069|i definitely think so.|S
fe066|yep mhh.|D
fe069|and i think there would be a lot more interesting data to analyze later on personally.|S
fe008|huh well uhhuh uhhuh that's right.|S
fe066|uhhuh.|B
fe008|because you're involved in gesture research.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|yeah because then you know exactly what's going on.|S
fe066|what the context cues are|D
fe069|and you can really get a feel for the interpersonal relationships.|S
fe066|yeah.|B
fe069|which kind of comes into play maybe not for speech recognition.|S
fe069|but for other things maybe.|S
fe066|maybe this is what it's like to be blind.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe008|oh interesting.|S
me070|huh.|B
fe069|maybe.|S
fe068|huh.|S
fe008|huh.|B
fe068|yeah.|B
me070|huh.|B
fe066|no no visual input at all.|S
fe069|yeah you just have to rely on your intonation.|S
fe069|and other things like that.|S
fe066|right.|S
fe066|and you get so much more aware of all of it too.|S
fe069|yeah uhhuh maybe.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe067|huh.|B
me070|yeah.|B
fe008|that's|D
fe008|i know someone who actually recognizes perfumes in the elevator.|S
fe008|i mean there's a there's a blind man in this in this building.|S
fe069|oh.|B
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and and um lila was in the elevator one day.|S
fe008|and they hadn't spoken yet.|S
fe008|because he just came on the elevator.|S
fe008|and he says|D
fe008|uh and then she then she said something.|S
fe008|and he says you you've changed your perfume.|S
fe066|oh wow.|S
fe008|yeah it's pretty interesting pretty interesting.|S
me070|huh.|B
fe069|that's pretty amazing.|S
fe068|had she changed her perfume?|Q
fe066|that's neat.|S
fe008|yes she had.|S
fe068|oh wow.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
fe066|huh.|B
me070|huh.|B
fe008|yeah.|B
fe068|oof!|S
fe008|yeah.|B
fe067|huh.|B
fe008|it's very interesting.|S
fe069|enhanced other senses i guess.|S
fe069|that's really cool.|S
fe066|right.|B
fe069|huh.|B
fe008|have you|D
fe008|i i've learned several things about having been with the close talking mikes.|S
fe008|this is this is a new experience.|S
fe008|because i have of course been involved in in this kind of thing for quite a while.|S
fe008|but there are several things i didn't realize you could hear so reliably.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and some of these are the things like when the mouth opens.|S
fe008|and the inbreath and stuff.|S
fe008|and it and how extremely audible and and visual.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe066|uhhuh.|B
fe067|uhhuh.|B
fe008|i mean you can see these the inbreaths and things.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|uhhuh.|B
fe008|it's that was really surprising to me that you it's that tangible.|S
me070|yeah.|B
fe069|that's something you don't hear in normal speech too.|S
fe068|uhhuh.|B
fe069|in normal conversations unless it's very dramatic or very loud|D
fe068|uhhuh.|B
fe069|that people click their their lips are always making funny noises.|S
fe067|unless you're on uh talking on the phone.|S
fe069|and|D
fe067|and the phone is the levels are funny.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe067|then you hear it.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe067|so it's kind of like that.|S
fe066|right.|B
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|i guess it's also one of these things that usually is not meaningful.|S
fe008|so we sort of screen it out.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|all these different|D
fe008|because you know i mean we do that all the time with all other well lots of other aspects of the acoustic signal.|S
me070|right.|B
fe069|yeah.|B
fe068|uhhuh uhhuh.|B
fe008|it sounds like it's a nice smooth melody.|S
fe008|but these things are voicing and unvoicing are tripping in and out.|S
fe008|and they don't the contour is really not nearly that neat.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
fe066|yeah.|B
fe068|right yeah well yeah most of the time when we're listening to other people's speech we're just trying to get the gist.|S
fe068|not literally what people are saying.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe067|huh.|B
fe068|and so|F
fe068|you know all the uh uh's and um's and all those different things|D
fe066|that's true.|S
fe069|yeah we filter all that out.|S
fe068|we just tune it out.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe068|yeah.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe068|and uh it's that top down thing again.|S
fe068|just|D
fe068|right?|Q
fe008|uhhuh yeah yeah absolutely absolutely.|S
fe068|in a way.|S
fe068|just trying to get the um|D
fe068|you know what is the what is the point of what this person is trying to communicate kind of thing.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|that's right.|S
fe068|so|F
fe067|huh.|B
fe069|which is a very it's that's how i tended before studying linguistics anyways and uh definitely before doing transcription how i tended to look all conversations|D
fe008|that's right.|S
fe069|and then coming here and doing this you have to look at speech in a totally more intense way.|S
fe069|um|F
fe069|including i mean every little aspect.|S
fe069|i and when i tell people what i do here|D
fe069|and tell them yeah i'm transcribing.|S
fe069|and they're they think i'm like a stenographer or something.|S
fe066|right.|B
fe068|yeah.|B
fe069|i'm like no i don't correct the grammar.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe069|i don't erase the um s and uh s.|S
fe069|i record all the sighs and the laughs and the breaths.|S
fe069|and and they're|D
fe069|i don't know.|S
fe069|this is a very different thing than most people can relate to i guess.|S
fe008|uhhuh the i agree.|S
fe069|or know about.|S
fe008|another thing that i think is interesting in these meetings is certain speakers have a tendency to embed utterances in other uh in other utterances.|S
fe008|and um you know it's very clear when you see it when you hear it with the intonational markers.|S
fe008|but well just the contours.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|but the words on the page it's not at all clear.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|and there are a couple people who do this in particular.|S
fe067|uhhuh.|B
fe008|i i would say that it's both i would say that both jerry and morgan do this.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and it's amazing how fluent it is when you hear it.|S
fe008|but how very complicated it is when you see the words.|S
fe066|indecipherable.|S
fe069|yeah.|D
fe008|yeah.|B
fe069|and when you think about it they pick up exactly where they left off.|S
fe069|even though maybe it's several seconds later there's no glitch in the syntax or anything.|S
fe069|it's we're pretty amazing machines.|S
fe069|or creatures.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe069|whatever.|S
fe008|huh.|B
me070|huh.|B
fe008|yeah.|B
fe069|that's really cool.|S
fe066|machines.|S
fe008|yeah.|D
fe008|so and then of course there are these these things which i think are also nicely represented in the data.|S
fe008|which are these funny sounds people make.|S
fe008|which to some degree is borrowing from comic talk.|S
fe008|so i notice people going pfft you know if they're trying to say something is done.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|the germans do this i think in particular.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe067|huh.|B
fe008|and there are others that we use like that|D
fe008|which are sort of semi-conventionalized.|S
fe008|but you wouldn't think that you would write them down.|S
fe066|yeah the one i i get all the time is tsk.|S
me070|yeah.|B
fe008|oh yes good example!|S
fe067|huh.|B
fe066|it's it's uh like i don't know how i just transcribe it as i say like click.|S
fe069|huh.|B
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe069|it's like|D
fe069|tisk.|S
fe066|and then i say it's like a vocal gesture.|S
fe066|like a shrug or a vocal some some sort of like well there it is.|S
fe008|yes.|B
me070|yeah.|B
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|or that's it.|S
me070|yeah.|B
fe066|or something like that you know.|S
fe066|that people do that one a lot.|S
fe066|and there was one speaker who used to do it constantly.|S
fe066|and after a while i started getting confused as to whether or not he was like just going tsk tsk tsk tsk tsk to himself.|S
fe066|or whether he was meaning it in|D
fe066|sometimes it was really obvious that he meant it as some sort of vocal cue.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe066|but then sometimes it was more ambiguous.|S
fe066|like it was tough to tell.|S
fe066|um because he would just always be clicking.|S
fe008|this is this the one that|D
fe008|i mean it could be the one that we were thinking about.|S
fe069|it could be.|S
fe069|but i noticed it more as it was obviously not|D
fe069|because it was always in a the one i'm thinking of always came in groups of four or something.|S
fe008|yes uhhuh.|S
fe069|and so it wasn't ever like a um single|D
fe066|huh.|B
fe066|oh okay.|S
fe008|it would be it would|D
fe066|yeah this guy does a lot of single ones.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe008|oh how interesting.|S
fe066|yeah just kind of um|D
fe066|and uh that's another thing like i i realize i do that too.|S
fe008|i'll ask you who this is later.|S
fe008|i don't want to because|D
me070|huh.|B
fe066|i can't remember the name actually.|S
fe008|okay.|S
fe008|the the one that i'm thinking of.|S
fe008|it's a matter of you can tell it's in context where he's looking in his agenda to see you know do i have time to do this.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and he's calculating it in his mind.|S
fe008|so it's sort of almost like a stand in for calculator kind of thing.|S
fe067|huh.|B
fe008|and uh but it's signaling.|S
fe008|i'm sure that everybody i'm sure that other people can hear it.|S
fe008|so it's sort of like wait a minute i'm thinking.|S
fe069|right yeah yeah yeah.|S
fe066|uhhuh.|B
fe008|but it's not lexicalized.|S
fe008|this is not a|D
me070|huh.|B
fe069|that's kind of the impression i got too.|S
fe008|not in a standard way.|S
fe066|oh yeah that's a different person.|S
fe008|it's|D
fe008|okay okay okay.|S
fe066|yeah okay i know who you're talking about.|S
fe066|but this is somebody somebody|D
fe008|he must do this in a lot of meetings.|S
fe008|because i think you know i've run across it several times.|S
me070|i don't think i've ever heard it.|S
fe069|no.|S
fe068|no.|S
fe069|huh.|B
fe068|i've heard.|S
me070|yeah.|D
fe008|yeah.|B
fe068|which i just transcribe as mouth.|S
fe008|heard that one.|S
fe008|oh i see.|S
fe068|i just make a mouth.|S
me070|huh.|B
fe068|because i think i had talked to you about this about|D
fe068|what what did we do because what was it that i|D
fe068|oh i was|D
fe068|lipsmack.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe008|oh yes.|S
fe066|yeah.|S
fe068|i was marking lipsmack.|S
fe068|and and you said|D
fe069|that's more like the.|D
fe068|yeah that's it's a different noise.|S
me070|huh.|B
fe069|yeah.|S
fe068|but um|F
fe068|it's what made me think of it.|S
fe067|uh.|S
fe068|but um|F
fe066|the one you're talking|D
fe068|and and you said don't do lipsmack.|S
fe068|just do we don't need it's too specific.|S
fe068|just do mouth for all all those noises.|S
fe008|yeah okay now what i would say um|D
fe068|um|F
fe008|it's good to know this.|S
fe008|what i what i would say is um if it's communicative beyond just the mouth opening and the oh you know the mechanical aspects that happen when you happen to be about to speak then i would like to have it if it's communicative i'd like to have it preserved.|S
fe068|uhhuh.|B
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe067|uhhuh.|B
me070|right.|S
fe008|but if it's just this mechanical stuff mouth is fine.|S
fe068|uhhuh.|B
fe008|the it seems like the computer science people use lipsmack for that.|S
fe008|i personally my choice|D
fe008|uh we've we're still deciding on how we're going to encode it in the final version.|S
fe008|but i tend to not like lipsmack.|S
fe008|because i think that that's could be meaningful.|S
fe008|and it's a little confusing.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|S
fe066|uhhuh.|B
fe008|people talk about you know oh gee that was really good.|S
fe067|huh.|B
fe008|and then they do a|D
fe008|i'm not going to do it.|S
fe008|because i don't really know how to do lipsmack.|S
fe008|but but it seems like it would be a a vocal gesture.|S
fe068|yeah.|B
fe069|it could be.|S
fe008|a definite type of thing.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|right yeah i was thinking the one that you just did like tsk makes me think of the what people would write as tsk tsk.|S
fe008|yes.|B
fe008|same here yeah.|S
fe069|yeah me too.|S
fe066|you know like uh as though they're like you know trying to communicate displeasure.|S
me070|yeah.|B
fe008|i would too.|S
fe068|oh right.|S
fe068|yeah.|S
fe067|huh.|B
me070|that's true yeah.|S
fe068|right.|F
fe068|uhhuh.|B
fe066|and so that|D
fe066|yeah.|B
fe067|huh.|B
fe066|there's there's at least two or three that i can think of that to me are very different.|S
fe066|you know there's like you know that.|S
fe068|right.|B
fe066|and there's like um you know well the one i did before that's like.|S
fe066|i don't know like um hhh.|S
fe008|i would say tongue click for that.|S
fe066|yeah.|S
fe008|but i would also probably put in parentheses it that i thought it was a vocal gesture.|S
fe066|uhhuh.|B
fe008|because i think it's communicative of a certain thing.|S
me070|yeah.|B
fe066|yeah.|B
me070|i don't know what i am never sure whether or not to transcribe um a difference with like huh you know and huh !.|S
fe069|oh yeah.|S
fe008|oh good point yes.|S
me070|like how do you transcribe huh !?|Q
fe069|it's like humph|D
fe066|i'll put like a|D
fe008|really good point.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
fe066|i'll usually put a an exclamation point somehow.|S
fe066|like i'll go|D
fe008|i would too.|S
me070|yeah?|Q
fe069|oh.|S
fe008|i think it's more emphatic.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me070|what about transcribing it um h.m.p. h?|Q
fe008|but it it's true that segments are different too.|S
me070|what about transcribing it that way?|Q
fe066|hmph.|B
me070|like hmph.|S
fe067|huh!|B
fe068|oh.|B
fe008|well now this is a good question.|S
fe008|i guess i would say you know sometimes we've seen hmph in literature meaning|D
me070|right.|B
fe008|but it's a a sigh a uh sorry a sound of indignation.|S
me070|right.|B
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|so if it's meant as a sound of indignation then i think that would be how i would capture it with the h.m.p.h. thing.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe069|i usually tend to think that it's a more of a|D
fe069|hhh not indignation.|S
fe069|something more positive.|S
fe069|i don't know exactly how to characterize it.|S
fe067|like|D
fe069|but something more|D
fe066|oh really?|Q
fe067|huh.|S
fe008|sort of like a uh an uh an elevated huh?|Q
fe067|i hadn't thought of that.|S
me070|right.|B
fe067|yeah.|B
fe008|it's like a sort of more surprise or engagement.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe069|huh.|B
fe069|yeah.|S
fe069|or|D
fe067|hhh.|B
fe069|i i don't know.|S
me070|yeah i guess it could have two meanings sort of.|S
fe069|maybe.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe068|if it's surprise then the exclamation point makes sense too.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|S
fe008|and then there's the other kind which sounds similar.|S
fe008|but it's really part of a laugh.|S
fe008|so uhhuh uhhuh huh.|S
fe068|huh.|B
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|which is i would just say laugh for that.|S
me070|yeah uhhuh.|B
fe066|laugh right.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe068|yeah once adam was laughing.|S
fe068|and it was actually written out phonetically.|S
fe068|and i changed it.|S
fe068|i'm like it's just laughing.|S
fe008|good.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|well done well done.|S
fe068|like somebody had written like hyuh-hyuh or or or something.|S
fe068|and|F
fe008|i've run across that also.|S
fe008|and|D
fe008|right.|B
fe008|change it to laugh.|S
me070|that's funny.|S
fe068|yeah i it was maybe tigerfish had done something.|S
fe008|well done.|S
fe068|like they had written out a phonetic laugh.|S
fe066|yeah yeah.|B
fe068|and they didn't do it at any other place in the transcript.|S
fe066|that's interesting.|S
fe069|that's interesting.|S
fe008|i ran across a couple ho s|D
fe068|it was just that one spot.|S
fe008|i've seen ho s.|S
fe068|it was just a regular old vanilla laugh you know.|S
me070|ho ho ho?|Q
fe008|and|D
me070|oh that is too much fun.|S
fe008|and heh.|S
fe068|it wasn't anything special.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
fe008|yeah that's right.|S
fe069|i noticed as far as problems with laughs is that a lot of them were marked as breaths.|S
fe008|we|D
fe069|because a lot of people|D
fe008|yes.|S
fe069|i think we already talked about this last time.|S
me070|right.|B
fe067|uhhuh.|B
fe069|but|D
fe008|yeah.|B
fe069|but not so much as i never saw that written out phonetically or whatever.|S
fe008|well|D
fe068|well|D
fe068|well here's a question.|S
fe068|and there's been some variance in transcripts that i've looked at.|S
fe068|when|D
fe068|okay.|F
fe068|so when you laugh you're exhaling all this air.|S
fe008|yes.|B
fe068|and so you need to inhale.|S
fe008|yes.|B
fe068|and so how do you transcribe the inhale?|Q
fe068|some people are transcribing it as a breath.|S
fe068|i used to you know back in the day back when i was transcribing i would do the whole thing as a laugh.|S
fe008|yeah yeah yeah yeah.|B
fe069|yeah that's what i used to do too.|S
fe008|uhhuh yeah yeah.|B
fe068|because to me the breath is part of the laugh.|S
fe008|i agree with you.|S
me070|oh yeah.|S
fe066|yeah.|B
fe008|that's that's what i prefer.|S
fe067|huh.|B
fe068|um so because because in the ones i've been the one i've been checking actually right now that breath gets marked as a breath.|S
me070|yeah.|B
fe068|and i've been taking them out.|S
fe069|so you would have like laugh breath laugh?|Q
fe008|good well done.|S
fe068|so that's okay?|Q
fe008|well done.|S
fe068|actually it'd be a laugh.|S
fe069|transcribed?|D
fe068|and then two dots.|S
fe068|like the next bin will be empty.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe068|and then it'll be breath.|S
fe069|oh i've|D
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe069|yeah.|S
fe068|and so it'll be that|D
fe066|yeah i was going to say i put|D
fe069|okay.|S
me070|oh.|S
fe069|i see what you're saying.|S
me070|yeah.|B
fe068|it'll be three sort of separate units as opposed to i think it's sort of one coherent thing.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe068|so|F
fe066|i put breath laugh in the brackets when i don't know whether it's a breath or a laugh.|S
fe008|that's good that's good.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe066|which is what i remember you telling me to do that.|S
fe068|oh well yeah that's that's a different thing.|S
fe008|that's right.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe067|huh okay.|B
fe068|yeah because sometimes it's not clear.|S
fe008|that's good.|S
fe069|sometimes it's hard to tell.|S
fe068|like sometimes hhh is a laugh.|S
fe067|yeah.|B
fe066|right.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
me070|yeah.|B
fe008|that's right.|S
fe066|right.|B
fe068|um and if other people are laughing then i'll usually give them and say that they're laughing.|S
fe067|huh.|B
fe008|and|D
fe008|i agree with you.|S
fe066|right.|B
fe008|and and i think that's important.|S
me070|yeah.|B
fe008|because we're capturing then the communicative level.|S
fe069|yeah exactly.|S
fe068|uhhuh exactly.|S
me070|right.|B
fe008|and it's likely that it has a different contour than most breaths as well.|S
fe069|yeah.|D
fe008|because it's sort of expulsive and and uh that kind of thing.|S
fe066|uhhuh.|B
fe068|uhhuh.|B
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|exactly exactly.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|a lot of people go.|S
fe008|well done.|S
fe068|so|F
fe008|yes they do.|S
fe008|yeah the shyer ones sometimes will laugh with the breath laugh.|S
fe008|and you can see it.|S
fe066|right.|S
fe008|you can see the little little peaks which is interesting.|S
fe066|right.|B
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe068|right.|B
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|but yes yeah exactly.|S
fe008|i wouldn't uh that's a case you know i know generally with the tigerfish things that they put breath and we leave it in.|S
fe008|but absolutely there yeah.|S
fe068|good okay.|S
fe008|laugh change it.|S
fe008|and you know there are other places where it's in the way you know|D
fe008|i i mainly said not to change their breath s simply because it would take time to move them if|D
fe008|and if they're not in the way then don't don't mess with it.|S
me070|a lot of times though the breaths are um results of bad segmentation.|S
fe008|but|D
me070|and there's a segmentation of nothing.|S
fe008|oh yes!|B
me070|and so they just write it as a breath when it's clearly not a breath.|S
fe069|yeah i've taken out some of those.|S
me070|and i usually always take those out.|S
fe068|yeah.|B
me070|i mean usually um it seems like the segmenter um often just sort of um segments|D
fe008|great.|B
me070|when there's really long spaces it segments random spaces in between.|S
me070|and you know they get that.|S
me070|and there's nothing there.|S
me070|so they mark it as a breath when it's really actually nothing.|S
me070|so usually i take those out.|S
fe008|that's right.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe068|well they give the segmenter though|D
fe068|because they don't have the the rich interface that we do.|S
fe068|so they must be giving the pre-segmenter sort of the benefit of the doubt.|S
fe068|well there must be something there um whether i can hear it or not.|S
me070|right right exactly exactly.|S
fe069|oh yeah i'm sure they are.|S
fe068|so they just say well it's a breath then.|S
me070|exactly.|S
fe008|one wonders what it might be|D
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe069|although they did put a missing segment sometimes in brackets.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
fe008|yeah there are some where|D
fe068|yes!|S
me070|oh really?|Q
fe068|that's true.|S
me070|oh i always get i always get breath.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
fe008|well see i i do a previous filtering before i give the tigerfish ones out.|S
fe069|i've gotten both.|S
fe008|and and i i have tried to get the that particular the the missing segment removed.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|but i don't always do it.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe069|yeah i've seen a few of them.|S
fe068|huh.|B
fe008|so yeah you've they slip through.|S
fe068|well frequently that'll also be a misattribution too of voice.|S
fe069|but i've seen a several breath s too.|S
me070|huh!|B
fe069|yeah yeah.|S
fe068|because then you'll hear you'll hear part of what another person is saying and and that's all transcribed on that one level.|S
fe068|but then you'll hear a little bit of it and then missing segment.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe068|it's like okay well they just it's in the wrong|D
fe069|it's just in the wrong place.|S
fe068|that person's not talking at all.|S
fe068|so you just get rid of it.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|huh.|B
fe068|so|F
fe008|uhhuh uhhuh.|D
fe069|yeah.|D
fe008|interesting.|S
fe008|okay well let's see.|S
fe008|so um do you think that this has changed your speech in other ways?|Q
fe008|in terms of|D
fe008|myself i do feel that i'm|D
fe008|when i spend a lot of hours doing this i become less fluent.|S
fe008|i have more false starts and things.|S
fe069|really?|Q
fe008|yeah.|S
fe008|i don't know if it's it could just be because there're so many more hours i haven't been talking.|S
fe068|huh!|B
fe066|i guess i try to be more careful in my speech more often.|S
fe008|good.|S
fe066|unless i'm really not paying any attention.|S
fe066|like you know if i'm at a party or something and i'm just sort of having a good time then it doesn't really matter.|S
fe066|but in you know normal one-on-one speech i i think i tend to try to enunciate more.|S
fe008|uhhuh uhhuh.|B
fe066|because i've been told i mumble.|S
fe008|oh huh.|S
fe066|um and i guess i used to be worse about it.|S
fe066|i was told by my parents that i used to mumble a lot.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe066|uh and also i i have this sort of east coast accent that comes in sometimes that makes it hard for people on the west coast to understand what i'm saying.|S
fe008|huh!|B
fe066|a lot of times like uh if i'm not paying attention i'll say something that uh will not really be heard.|S
fe066|i tend to leave off final consonants for instance.|S
fe066|and people uh i have to be conscious of that sometimes.|S
fe008|huh.|B
fe066|yeah so|F
fe008|so mainly for clarity it sounds like like in phrasing or strategies.|S
fe066|yeah.|S
fe066|yeah.|B
fe069|huh one thing that i noticed|D
fe069|i don't know if it's a really a question of me being more changing my speech necessarily.|S
fe069|but i'm much more aware of interruptions in conversation in normal conversation.|S
fe008|oh.|S
fe068|oh yeah that's true.|S
fe008|oh.|B
fe066|yeah.|D
fe069|so uh maybe i am more careful in the sense that i maybe don't interrupt as much.|S
fe069|or i'm more aware of it when i am doing it.|S
fe069|or something like that.|S
fe069|but um i just pay attention more to the fact that every pretty much all the time in normal conversation there are interruptions.|S
fe069|there's no|D
fe069|i mean unless you have really|D
fe069|i mean i think if there were no interruptions it would sound really awkward.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe069|there would be a lot of pauses.|S
fe069|and that would kind of imply uncomfortability or something.|S
fe067|huh.|B
fe066|right.|B
me070|yeah.|B
fe069|but|F
fe008|i guess it depends partly on the type of interruption.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|i mean if it's a clarifying type like well do you mean when they're partway through it in a utterance|D
fe069|yeah.|B
fe069|yeah.|B
fe069|yeah.|B
fe069|it's different.|D
fe066|yeah i tend to think of a conversation that has no interruptions as being something that's unnatural and forced.|S
fe066|or something like a meeting where you know i mean everybody says their little schpiel.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|and people are meant to be you know pretty pretty quiet and attentive for the most part.|S
fe066|and then they let them finish.|S
fe066|and then somebody else comes in.|S
fe066|and says something about it.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|um|F
fe066|and in a like a friendly conversation i i notice that that's not really true.|S
fe066|like what you were saying.|S
me070|right.|B
fe069|but even in cases like that even when it is|D
fe069|see now i'm contradicting myself.|S
fe069|but even when it is very turn taking is very like people follow the turn taking rules or whatever and don't really blatantly interrupt people|D
fe069|um|F
fe069|and i i remember this actually from a meeting because liz was complaining there wasn't enough interruptions.|S
fe069|or not enough overlaps or something.|S
fe066|huh.|B
fe069|it wasn't interruptions.|S
fe069|it was overlaps that i was thinking about.|S
fe008|uhhuh i think this is really|D
fe069|not enough overlaps.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
fe069|and so she wanted to there to be an argument or something so that there'd be more.|S
fe069|and what she didn't realize was that throughout the meeting up until then there had been.|S
fe069|they were just very small.|S
fe069|but they were there.|S
fe069|i think they're there pretty much all the time.|S
fe008|i agree.|S
fe008|i did i did do one analysis where i looked at one meeting|D
fe066|that's interesting.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and um|F
fe008|because the claim had been|D
fe008|actually one of the people in the meeting had made the claim in the previous meeting that well there probably the overlaps only occur during setup and um you know at the end when we're leaving.|S
fe069|oh.|S
fe068|oh yeah that's totally not true.|S
fe067|huh.|B
fe066|no not at all.|S
fe008|exactly exactly.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|well and you know i think that that's sort of the feeling you would get if unless you looked at the data at this level.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|right.|B
fe008|and so i did an analysis.|S
fe008|and in fact it was really a pretty constant rate.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|all the way through the entire meeting.|S
fe008|and everyone was involved.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|wasn't just one you know or two speakers.|S
fe008|everyone was|D
fe008|yeah it's quite true.|S
fe066|kind of makes sense.|S
fe066|because if you're if you want to speak next it's almost like you got you got to get your foot in the door.|S
fe066|you got to be the one who you know make sure people recognize that you're the one who's going to speak next.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|that's true.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|i should say i didn't distinguish between overlaps and and interruptions.|S
fe008|so some of these were backchannels and things like that.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|oh i see.|S
fe008|but it's still it's still the case.|S
fe066|uhhuh.|B
fe008|you have|D
me070|yeah.|B
fe008|you|D
me070|i think um silences are generally like not good in conversation too.|S
me070|because once you get a|D
me070|you know it it it's to your benefit to to try to get in right when you think they're done.|S
me070|because if there's a silence not only is it awkward but then that sort of cues everybody to start thinking of a new topic to stop the silence.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe067|huh.|B
me070|and then you don't get to talk about what you wanted to talk about because the whole subject has changed.|S
fe069|and then everybody talks at once.|S
fe008|that's true that's very true.|S
fe069|you know thinking about it|D
me070|you know?|Q
fe069|i i think i've only noticed a couple times where there's been actual silence on all channels for a period of time.|S
me070|yeah.|B
fe068|uhhuh.|B
fe067|huh.|B
fe069|it's only been like twice.|S
fe008|it's true that's very rare.|S
fe068|it's rare.|S
fe066|yeah.|D
fe008|i agree.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|interesting observation.|S
fe008|yeah well if they're if this has raised a couple of things for me that i wanted to mention.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|because you know at this point we're at the at the really fine grain level of of standardization which i hadn't really thought of specifying in advance before.|S
fe008|and um wanted to maybe just mention a couple of things.|S
fe008|these are|D
fe008|um|F
fe008|yeah i don't think that these are very common.|S
fe008|but with the idea that what we're trying to do is encode the communicative stuff.|S
fe008|um when we have these grey areas.|S
fe008|um um|F
fe008|i wanted to draw attention to the fact that there are sometimes these stretches where a person is trying to say something and formulating their thought and they're coming out with a bunch of segments which really aren't part of a word.|S
fe008|have you run across that where they're they're saying?|Q
fe069|huh.|B
fe066|uhhuh.|S
fe066|yeah yeah yeah.|S
fe069|yeah yeah yeah.|S
me070|yeah.|S
fe008|and then they say a word.|S
fe067|oh.|D
fe066|right.|B
fe068|yeah.|S
fe008|and my feeling on that is that this isn't really a phonological transcript.|S
fe008|and potentially those things could probably be rendered.|S
fe008|although some of them are not even full segments.|S
fe008|they're even subsegmental i would say.|S
fe008|i mean you got a a single flap of a vocal cord sometimes.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
me070|yeah.|B
fe008|and you know they're it's like the the apparatus is sort of almost kicking in.|S
fe008|they're almost going to say.|S
fe008|but it hasn't somehow this somehow this vibration hit before the rest of it.|S
fe008|and and that's not communicative.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|so um my my the way i do those things when i hear those if is to i use in parentheses one x. so it's marked.|S
fe066|okay.|S
me070|right.|B
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|or if it's then i then i put six or seven or however many it is|D
fe069|then|D
me070|that's what i usually do too.|S
fe069|right.|B
fe068|i was wondering who had been putting those in.|S
me070|yeah.|B
fe008|great.|S
fe008|and then and then what i do is i put in um brackets um uncodeable sorry uncodeable vocal sounds.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe068|yes.|S
fe066|oh okay okay.|S
fe008|and of course potentially they're codable.|S
fe008|but i just wanted to mark roughly how how long it is.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|then indicate what what the nature of it is so no one's going to try and go back and and decode it as something that's a word that was not it has a different status than parenthesized uh parts when there are words involved.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|just to set it aside.|S
fe008|have some sort of a length indication.|S
fe008|and sometimes i'll even put them in a in a separate bin.|S
fe008|although that's that's not necessary.|S
fe008|it's just sometimes it works out that way that they.|S
fe068|uhhuh.|B
fe008|they do this thing.|S
fe008|i shouldn't do that so often.|S
fe008|i'm sorry about that.|S
fe008|they do this sound.|S
fe008|and then there's a pause.|S
fe008|and then they start speaking.|S
fe068|uhhuh.|B
fe008|so then it's really obvious i can i can split it apart and it won't be any problem.|S
fe008|i wanted to mention that one.|S
fe068|man.|D
fe066|i'm glad you brought that up.|S
fe008|yeah.|S
fe066|because i actually|D
fe066|i'm one of the culprits that puts in all the little itsy bitsy tiny sounds in the middle of everything.|S
fe069|huh.|B
fe068|i do that too!|S
fe066|because i was|D
fe068|i used to do that!|S
fe066|because|D
fe066|yeah because i was thinking like you're just supposed to write down everything you hear as closely as possible.|S
fe008|well|D
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe066|and so i'm glad you said that.|S
fe066|because um that actually takes a good amount of time and like pretty strict concentration to to do that.|S
fe068|a lot of time.|S
me070|yeah.|S
me070|yeah i put in the x. s.|S
fe066|um|F
fe008|excellent.|S
fe066|and so|F
me070|i put in if it's um unintelligible i put i count how many syllables and then i put in six x. .|S
fe066|i do that if it's unintelligible.|S
fe066|but if i can tell something if somebody goes i'll put an r. .|S
fe008|oh i see.|S
fe008|i see.|S
fe066|uh um so if they go i'll go r. e.h. huh m. m. .|S
me070|oh.|S
fe067|huh.|B
fe066|so like i i've been doing that.|S
fe066|because like that's what i can hear.|S
fe008|okay.|S
fe066|and i'm pretty damn sure that|D
me070|right.|B
fe066|sorry sorry!|S
fe066|sorry hhh.|S
me070|that will have to be transcribed with little uh symbols.|S
fe066|sorry!|S
fe066|i'm sorry.|S
fe068|yeah like a a skull and crossbones.|S
fe066|i feel really bad now.|S
fe066|oh no!|S
fe066|i'm sorry.|S
me070|right.|D
fe066|okay.|S
fe008|that's okay.|S
fe008|it's all right.|S
me070|you've ruined the whole meeting!|S
fe008|no problem.|S
me070|we can't transcribe any of it now!|S
fe068|it's not it's|D
fe066|oh no i'm so sorry.|S
fe068|yeah.|D
fe068|it's not like you said the f. word.|S
fe008|no no no.|S
fe068|it's not it's not an|D
fe008|this is not|D
fe068|it's still a p.g.|S
fe069|yeah seriously.|S
fe008|i wouldn't give it a second thought.|S
fe069|do you remember what you were going to say?|Q
fe066|oh yeah i i was|D
fe068|she's pretty darn sure that uh|D
fe066|uh and then yeah that's|D
fe008|you|D
fe008|yeah|F
fe068|she could make it out probably.|S
me070|okay right.|S
fe066|i'm sorry.|S
fe068|yeah no one's ever sworn in any of the meetings.|S
fe008|well you've heard have you heard shoot?|Q
fe068|that actually|D
fe008|i've heard shoot a couple of times.|S
fe066|i've heard the|D
fe069|yeah.|B
fe068|not the swearword version.|S
me070|huh.|B
fe008|no no no no no no.|S
fe008|the|D
fe068|just shoot.|S
fe008|shoot type yeah.|S
fe066|i've heard the swearword version.|S
me070|yeah.|B
fe068|that's okay.|S
fe066|remember that?|Q
me070|oh you have?|D
fe008|yeah?|Q
fe066|remember that?|Q
me070|i've never heard the swearword versions.|S
fe008|oh.|S
fe066|it was a while back.|S
fe066|i it was a long time ago.|S
fe008|i do remember that yeah.|S
fe066|yeah and i was like oah.|S
fe066|i emailed you.|S
fe066|i was like you might want to check this out.|S
fe008|that's right that's right.|S
fe066|yeah i do remember that.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
fe066|but it was very quiet.|S
fe066|so i can see how that would have been sort of gone over by accident.|S
fe066|it was just very quiet.|S
fe066|like kind of under the breath kind of thing.|S
fe008|uhhuh yeah.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|yeah it was.|S
fe066|so that's why it was missed.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|i can understand.|S
fe068|huh!|B
fe067|uhhuh.|B
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe066|yeah.|S
fe008|yeah.|S
fe008|but finish your point.|S
fe008|so|D
fe066|oh i was just i was just saying that um i i can i'm pretty sure that i can tell what exactly what sounds are being produced.|S
fe008|yes.|S
fe066|so if it's uh i write an r. .|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me070|right.|B
fe066|if it's huh i can tell it's.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|right.|B
fe008|uhhuh uhhuh.|B
me070|then again i always think that it's closer to stick with the x. s.|S
me070|because it's like how effective is you know the roman alphabet at deciphering all the sounds that a human can make?|Q
fe069|yeah.|S
me070|you know it's not the i.p.a.|S
me070|and it's just i i just sort of think um it's best to leave it with x. s.|S
fe067|huh.|B
me070|because i english orthography conventions are just so you know uncertain anyway in the first place.|S
me070|and um|F
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me070|you know i i usually only use them when i i know that um the person was trying to make a word.|S
me070|i mean i know that the the word they were trying to say.|S
me070|and that they were stuttering that.|S
me070|then i feel fine just you know writing out the letters.|S
me070|but otherwise i sort of don't feel right trying to write them out.|S
me070|because i feel like it's um|D
me070|you can't really|D
fe066|just not useful?|Q
me070|yeah you can't really spell those things with the with the roman alphabet.|S
fe068|uhhuh.|B
fe066|yeah.|B
me070|you know?|Q
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|uhhuh.|B
me070|it's it was only set up for|D
fe068|right.|B
me070|it was set up for a different purpose you know.|S
me070|not necessarily so phonological.|S
fe008|i agree and i think there's another problem too.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe066|okay.|S
fe008|and that is that we do have some short words which are communicative.|S
fe008|and and sometimes|D
fe008|so if you have an e.r. as part of one of these fragments we do have a lexicalized uh.|S
me070|right.|B
fe008|which is a which is a a filler item.|S
fe066|right.|B
fe008|does have a meaning.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|so i think for both of the reasons it's good to just leave it in this category of not really communicating in a in a word like way.|S
fe066|so even if it's uh or|D
me070|right.|B
fe008|i would keep uh.|S
fe008|well e. uh uh if it's a filler.|S
fe066|oh you would keep uh.|S
fe008|so i mean uh|D
fe066|right right.|S
fe008|that that that stays.|S
me070|huh|B
fe066|right oh okay.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
me070|oh yeah.|S
fe008|but if it's uh part on these little fragments no.|S
me070|i always|D
me070|i often transcribe that as or.|S
me070|i always thought that was or sort of with a strange pronunciation.|S
fe008|oh.|S
fe008|i'm making a distinction.|S
fe068|oh.|S
fe008|so you have the um comic uh where the person says something and then they pretend that they didn't want to say that.|S
me070|right.|B
fe008|and then they throw in an uh.|S
me070|oh.|S
fe008|and that would be an uh.|S
me070|oh i don't get that one.|S
fe066|uhhuh.|B
fe069|uhhuh.|B
me070|right.|S
fe008|e.r.|S
fe008|but if they're saying or in a reduced way so it comes out as uh do it as or.|S
me070|right.|B
me070|okay.|S
fe008|because that's that falls within the realm of pronunciation variants.|S
fe069|okay.|S
me070|okay.|S
fe066|right.|B
me070|right.|S
fe008|it's just like different ways of saying and.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|okay.|S
fe008|and i have like uh uh two more things i wanted to say.|S
fe008|one of them is um|D
fe008|oh yeah.|F
fe008|this is an interesting category to me.|S
fe008|and i don't um don't have to mark this systematically.|S
fe008|but when you're going through the meeting and what i'd like people to do if if you're not uh uh is to go through the meeting|D
fe008|um|F
fe008|so if you're doing you're doing separate channels first and then as a final pass through the mixed channel.|S
fe008|i don't think i've made that explicit.|S
fe008|but it it's really helpful to go through it a a final time though the mixed channel so that you hear things in context.|S
fe008|and at that point what i sometimes pick up is this meta level where someone is finishes someone's someone else's utterance|D
fe069|uhhuh.|D
fe008|so you'll suddenly have this stranded word out in the middle of nowhere and it's because.|S
fe008|this other speaker on this other channel was trying to formulate this thought and they paused.|S
fe008|and they paused just enough that this person leaped in and gave them a word.|S
fe069|huh.|B
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe066|right.|B
fe008|and i think those are interesting.|S
fe008|so when i find that i i note note it as you know finishing.|S
fe008|put capital letters.|S
fe008|capital letter capital letter colon apostrophe s. utterance.|S
fe069|oh.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
fe068|wait wait how do you mark it?|S
me070|wait.|S
fe066|we add the|D
fe008|so if so in the in the instance in which|D
fe008|let's say that um morgan's talking.|S
fe008|uh so he's talking.|S
fe008|and then somewhere there's a bit of a pause.|S
fe008|and let's say adam fills in a word for him.|S
fe008|then what i do is on adam's channel i say i say completing and this this isn't that common of an occurrence completing speaker initial with a colon apostrophe s. s utterance.|S
fe068|oh i see.|S
fe069|oh.|S
me070|oh.|B
fe068|okay.|S
fe008|and what that means is at the time when we|D
fe008|see we're going to go to a stage of anonymization.|S
fe008|so it's important to have the colon here.|S
me070|oh.|B
fe008|because that'll make it possible to easily know you know who it was without having to do the math involved in figuring out which channel it was.|S
fe008|the problem with|D
fe008|i originally wanted to use channel numbers as the referent index.|S
fe008|but that that's not functional.|S
fe008|because we have these two different numbering schemes.|S
fe008|you have the numbering in the channeltrans interface and you have the numbering in the key file.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|and those can be very different.|S
me070|right right.|B
fe008|so you know to be able to|D
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|uh this is redundant in a useful way in that you know that you're not going to make a mistake.|S
fe008|i tried to do it with the numbers.|S
fe008|and i was making all sorts of inconsistent problems so i stopped it.|S
fe066|so that's probably why you like added in that um thing that automatically puts in the people's initials.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe069|initials?|Q
fe008|that's that's i did that partly to keep track of things.|S
fe008|absolutely.|S
fe008|absolutely.|S
fe069|i also found that it was easier to deal with the meetings when there are speaker initials.|S
fe066|uhhuh.|B
fe066|oh yeah.|S
fe066|initials.|S
fe008|the initials?|Q
fe008|i'm glad to hear that.|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe008|i i didn't do that systematically until uh really rather recently.|S
fe069|yeah.|B
fe008|so i'm glad to know that's useful.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|it takes an extra step.|S
fe008|glad it's useful.|S
fe008|okay now i just have one more thing to say.|S
fe008|and that is that|D
fe008|um um|F
fe008|like once this is just such a|D
fe008|i'm getting down to like the really eensy-weensy stuff.|S
fe008|but um once i found a comment that uh in curly brackets about mumbling.|S
fe008|and um|F
fe008|that's that's this is just to mention an instance that happened once.|S
fe008|it's really grasping for details.|S
me070|uhhuh.|B
fe008|but um|F
fe008|i i i think and it may be that it was not from anybody here.|S
fe008|so|F
fe008|but i think that um mumble is only useful in the to me in the sense of whispered.|S
fe008|if it's like a manner of speaking in which case it's a qual.|S
fe008|but not in terms of replacing like this string of undecipherable fragments.|S
fe008|so|F
me070|oh right.|S
fe066|right oh yeah.|S
fe069|okay.|S
fe008|um this this was when it was used.|S
me070|they used mumble for|D
fe008|exactly.|S
fe008|it was used in place of uh something that was unintelligible.|S
fe069|okay.|D
fe066|to fill in i see.|S
me070|huh.|B
me070|right.|S
fe008|in which case it would be better to use parentheses and and either exclamation or the number of syllables if you know.|S
me070|the number x. .|S
fe068|and then do qual mumbled or qual whispered or something.|S
fe008|exactly if it's a manner of speaking then it's useful.|S
fe068|i see.|S
me070|right.|B
fe008|and otherwise the parentheses with an estimate of syllables is better.|S
fe069|okay.|B
fe068|okay.|S
fe008|okay.|S
fe008|so i guess you know i don't want to keep you.|S
fe008|i kept you so long.|S
fe069|can i ask one more thing about these comments?|Q
fe008|i really appreciate this.|S
fe008|yes.|S
fe069|so we are for|D
fe069|qual is used for things like whispered or said while laughing or things of that nature.|S
fe008|yes.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe069|um i remember at some point we were doing a difference between vocal and non vocal sounds.|S
fe008|oh yes.|S
fe008|oh but|D
fe008|good question.|S
fe008|and you don't have to add any of those tags.|S
fe069|oh.|S
fe008|the only tags that you need to add is|D
fe008|so uh there's like one exception that's just microscopic.|S
fe008|and that is sometimes|D
fe008|this is again really rare.|S
fe008|sometimes i've run across the word noise.|S
fe008|and offhand i don't know if that's a vocal noise or non vocal noise.|S
fe066|huh.|D
fe008|and so then i listen to it and i figure it out.|S
fe008|but that's the only place you would use a vocal non vocal tag.|S
fe008|where it's potentially ambiguous between those two categories.|S
fe008|because otherwise what i do when i get these is|D
fe008|and of course i do my checks.|S
fe008|and then i have a um a script that i wrote which will separate everything in out that has curly brackets.|S
fe008|do a listing of them.|S
me070|huh.|D
fe008|and then anything|D
fe008|some of them already have tags from some previous uh modification.|S
fe008|but anything that doesn't i just go through this list and i i tag it right then.|S
fe008|and so in one in one in one change i can modify you know five hundred instances of this.|S
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe069|uhhuh.|B
fe008|so there's no need to add the vocal or the non vocal.|S
fe069|very efficient.|S
fe069|okay but for like noise that we know is something like mike noise or something like a door whatever then we can mark it as that.|S
fe068|huh.|B
fe066|right.|B
fe068|uhhuh.|B
fe008|yes.|B
fe069|and|D
fe008|you can either if you mark it mike noise then i'll know what kind of noise it is when i go through the thing and put v.o.c. or n.v.c. on the in the substitution file.|S
fe069|yeah right.|S
fe069|or|D
fe069|or if it's|D
me070|uhhuh.|D
fe069|right.|B
fe008|but it's it's uh very efficient for me to add those tags later.|S
fe069|okay.|S
fe008|it's really not the same thing with the qual.|S
fe008|just so long as i can tell which of those three categories it is.|S
fe008|or or pron.|S
fe008|but you know those that's really very obvious.|S
fe008|the pronunciation.|S
me070|yeah.|S
fe008|so long as i can tell what they are.|S
fe069|so we do need to add that one?|Q
fe008|i think it's good for you to add the pron.|S
fe069|okay sure okay.|S
fe008|i would appreciate the pron come to think of it.|S
fe068|good.|S
fe008|but the other three just so long as it's clear to me you know from the comment which of those three it is then i'm fine.|S
fe068|good.|S
fe008|that's great.|S
fe008|all right so um i guess um|D
fe068|do you want to read digits?|Q
fe068|do you want to do that?|Q
fe008|oh thank you.|S
fe008|do we have time?|Q
fe008|would you mind?|Q
fe069|yeah that's fine.|S
fe008|can we do digits?|Q
me070|yeah that's fine.|S
fe068|no.|S
fe066|yeah.|S
fe008|okay so why don't|D
fe008|do you want to do it uh in unison this time?|Q
fe069|that's what we did last time.|S
fe068|well we did it in unison last time.|S
fe066|we did it|D
fe008|oh we did!|S
fe069|yeah.|S
fe008|oh.|S
me070|right.|S
fe008|do it separately then okay.|S
fe068|sure did.|S
me070|yes.|S
fe008|good deal.|S
fe068|oh and do you want us to mark the roughly the time we start?|Q
fe008|that is really what that time field is.|S
fe008|i used to think it was the beginning of the meeting.|S
me070|oh okay.|S
fe008|but yes.|S
fe008|quite right quite right.|S
fe068|oh okay.|S
fe008|that'd be good.|S
me070|oh all right.|S
fe066|the time we start digits?|Q
fe068|so we have to|D
fe069|huh.|D
fe008|yeah.|S
fe066|okay.|S
fe008|okay so who wants to start?|S
fe008|well i guess i'll start.|S
fe008|okay.|S
fe008|um|F
fe008|okay i wanted to make one comment and that is some of these are like two digits.|S
fe008|and just be sure you say both digits separately.|S
fe008|so one eight instead of eighteen.|S
fe008|okay?|Q
fe068|sure.|S
me070|oh right.|S
fe066|i can go.|S
fe008|okay.|S
fe008|okay wonderful.|S
fe008|thank you very very much.|S
fe008|i really appreciate this.|S
fe068|no problem.|S
me070|sure.|S
fe008|and um so now we get to turn the microphones off.|S
fe066|sure.|S
fe008|and uh|F
